# Podcast Transcription/Diarization ðŸ”ˆ

This sample that will take the [Invest like the Best Podcast](https://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/) and transcribe it using [Azure Batch Speaker diarization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription#speaker-separation-diarization) into the following format:

```javascript
{
    "transcription_result": [
        {
            "speaker" : "1",
            "words" : "hello and welcome everyone i'm patrick o'shaughnessy and this is invest like the best...",
            "confidence": 0.881108
        }
        {
            "speaker" : "2",
            "words" : "There's no good answer, but there are definite good fit answers, so...",
            "confidence": 0.5449745
        }
    ]
}
```

## âœ… Requirements

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Python 3.8.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Swagger CodeGen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
- [Jupyter + VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)
- [Azure Speech Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/)


## ðŸŽ¯ Getting started

Run the following commands (also in the Jupyter notebook) to install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install ./python-client

## Usage

- Open the Juptyer notebook in VS Code.
- Run the setup scripts to create the resources in Azure
- Download a sample podcast audio file or provide your own
- Upload and submit the transcription to the default Azure Speech Model for transcription + diarization

## TODO:

### Cost

Azure Speech prices [Conversation Transcription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) at $2.10/hour of audio. For a roughly 1 hour single channel audio file we were able to achieve transcription and diarization for roughly $0.57 USD including storage and networking costs.

### Output Formatting 
By default. Batch transcription diarization outputs a complex [transcription diarization result](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription#batch-transcription-result)

In future versions of this sample we will try to process the diarized result into sentence level fragments based on the speaker object.
