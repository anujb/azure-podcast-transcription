song hurst the former head of strategy at microsoft and a prolific investor having personally invested in nearly five hundred companies through his careeer i met charlie at an event hosted in new york and you can tell within one minute of meeting him that his mind is sparkling with ideas and curiosity it's no wonder he's been among the most commonly requested guests when i asked several top investors in ceos who i should have on the show we discuss the lessons he's learned about business investing in people from such a large sample size of companies i won't reveal anymore here i highly recommend you just listen to charlie and learn let's dive in charlie i like starting these things in a unique way an one idea that you've had is to have people stack rank their vices of power money and fame i help you to begin by explaining why you're interested in this idea and what you've learned from the answers over the years so it's a two part question one is the virtues which is working with people you like working on amazing problems and having impact and then the three vices power money and fame and you can't avoid them they have to be stacked going to separately an it's really trying to get at the differences between there's no good answer but there are definite good fit answers so someone who's interested in power tends to be better at execution someone 's more interested in money tends to think more about some capital efficiency i tend to avoid people interested in fame but if you are doing something in showbiz it would presumably be the number one criteria if you think about the different streams sort of impact intellectual interest working with people you really get impression of where people are going to be happy and where they're not going to be happy you also start to understand why certain organizations do so well so spacex if you think about it stacks high unhealthily it's interesting that you're working with amazing people in your huge utilitarian impact in the world whereas if you're working sent fintech you're less likely to sort of that utilitarian positive impact any especially memorable or interesting series of answers that you've gotten on the two stack ranks that come to mind a lot of people have negative utility from fame alot of people start with power and then when you push them it's actually money but they don't want to say it and that's more true outside of the U S culture than it is in the U S it's particularly true with europeans and so a lot of it is trying to get people to actually say what they truly believe as opposed to say what they think they should say i'm curious in what context whether it be interviewing perspective founders interviewing central hires or others you find it most interesting and useful all of the above the founder one is fascinating could you actually end up going down different lines and helping them depending on whether they answer the power and the money founders advance with power tend to need help more on managing their startup capital efficiently they tend to be the ones that spend more they tend to be the ones that over expand their often too aggressive converse with the ones that answer money tend to be very capital efficient but often slightly too cautious slightly under aggressive sometimes not willing enough to stamp their authority on the company and make it the culture that it needs to be to be successful when it comes to hiring or evaluating founders apart from this two part stack ranking are there other favorite questions or devices that you return to again and again i think what you're looking for is founder market fit i think there's a sort of mistaken concept that does protonic ideal of an entrepreneur and i think maybe there's two basic things there's energy in this sort of cognitive ability but after that you're really looking for fit so if you take the sort of prototypical consumer founder they tend to have more empathy for how people behave well as if you take the classic enterprise founder they tend to be more national because in some ways you can just go and ask your customers what features do you want and go build them and so you go down those different lines and i think there's a lot of fallacy in that sort of atomic ideal what you're actually looking for is someone who is a good fit for business i'd like to take a step back now and introduce you to the audience a little bit one device that i've been using with people on the podcast is to ask you to give the thumbnail two minutes sketch of your life and career up until this point studied politics first with economics at oxford ended up very briefly mckinsey then at microsoft and then sort of mumbled my way and becoming an investor and do a lot of angel investing so i think i've done about five hundred angel investments like the actual numbers four hundred eighty three and about three hundred in the portfolio at the moment i believe you ran strategy at microsoft what exactly did that entail and what is most memorable about that time this so many memories working with amazing people the hostile acquisition of yahoo as an attempt was just unbelievably into actually fascinating trying to buy a company in a half stack position for i think it's forty seven billion dollars and just the drama and the soap opera and realizing how much path dependency matters and big deals how much are casual comment misinterpreted by one side or the other actually changes the outcome it's remarkable how little system theory there is in the sense of if you an experiment so again and again i think you would get a lot of different results in M and a activity wells and things like product usage good products and bad product would probably be the same in each experiment four hundred and eighty three investments is a crazy amount i want to come back to your time at microsoft probably later on and talk in more depth about strategy but given the sheer volume of investments that you made i think a great place to begin our conversation is your idea or your thinking around why startups succeed and fail i'd love to begin by you outlining sort of what if anything is shared in common across those four hundred and eighty three so are there certain features that you're always looking for and sort of how your process works and then we'll get into the success and failure of startups in some ways to tie together so i think the dominant sort of failure mode for startups is the same at each different stage so that sort of pre seed to seed you basically have a failure to achieve labor productivity which is really just a polite way of saying the team doesn't come together doesn't gel and produce good output usually a team that just produces good work or generate enough sort of kinetic energy to get continuing funding once you sort of going from seed to series a it's another single cause which is how to get product market fit you're basically on the search for demand curve and you either find one where you don't find one and this is where you've got the highest element of pure chance in the startup it's always feels akin to sort of gold prospecting in the california gold rush which is you can be good or you can be bad you can do the right thing you can do the wrong thing but there's some elusive amanda chance the why is this perspector with the best maps and the most intelligent strategy sometimes just won't find it and someone will just fall asleep put the pan in the stream some golden come out and there really is a little nexos of serendipity at this stage then when you move to series a it's really all about labor productivity but in a different form it's can the manager scale and one of the fallacy 's is most early stage startup founders think their managers and they're actually not what they have is a team that's actually managing them 'cause when you're managing say ten or less people and you're spending time with them everyday what's actually happening is there managing you buy influence because they know you well enough and they talked to enough to work out what your desires are so as long as you're articulate and energetic and sort of engaged you actually don't have to manage the team managers you up but when you scale to thirty people to ninety people above you no longer have those personal connections and you have to move to formal management techniques and that's i can sort of fermi paradox great filter it wipes out an amazing amount of startups and the way that's divins tis a collapse in the labor productivity per person there's a term in microeconomics good managerial dis economies of scale and i think in some ways the angle of the decline of productivity per person is the difference between sort of the stripes the great startups and the failures and maybe if you're great start up as you go from ten people to one hundred people output per person drops fifteen percent and if you're a bad start up it actually drops over ninety percent with the result that often hundred people startups produce arrest and they did when they had ten people because the managerial collapse has been so extreme and wonder somethings if you get this comedy skit by big maybe there's a sort of interesting explanation where more than the shared attributes was an instinct for the sort of structures and processes and management that were shared between gates sucker burg basals the color things all these sort of super counter people because my guess is they didn't receive form instruction on it there be season advisors want that help form it it may be either by chance or by skill they just intuitive their way through it then when you get beyond that sort of series B and beyond i think it's institution building interesting problems is sort of people that become entrepreneurs are often full of energy and sort of flexibility or mister sort of combination of street smart and book smart but there's a point where they've hit product market fit were actually what they're doing is repeating a process at scale and tucupita process at scale you need to build an institution and often that sort of is almost an automatic to their personality if you're going to take in revenue from forty two countries you really need a well developed finance department once you get to a certain size you will always be in court cases because of being sued by ex employees you have patent infringement suits you'll be debt collecting customers didn't pay like the shift to sort of building an institution with institutional norms institutional values for institutional culture and all the boring stuff of buildings from finance department strong legal department from HR department that again is a big filter and so those are sort of filters by stages what symptoms some of those you can do when you submit some precede wondering if this would close my eyes and they can't imagine this person on a public company conference call remembering the let's put in the microsoft as a microsoft learning schools and i'm thinking can i imagine them sitting as a sort of SEO next CFO talking with all the sort of most reactive analysts and the buy side and the phone and just be incredible enough and deep enough mature enough to pull that off it's a fascinating set of framing the one that jumps out as maybe most interesting to me is this idea of the declining curve of peoples productivity and in your experience whether or not that is something that is typically in eight to the founder meaning they just handle that naturally and with the plum or if instead it's something perhaps that could be coached and if it's really just a set of best practices that are fairly universal that founders just don't get i think the irony is it is absolutely something that can and should be coached but often isn't so often the people that get it intuitively other people that survive but there's no need for that it can just be coached in and i think a lot of it is you get this very strong transition when your voice will start up most of the people you're employing just come in and do their job and go home and the drawback of that is you tend to end up having to do type management alot of micro management and the beauty of it is you tend to get available level politics within the organization then you get this transition to wear your hiring people that are sort of execs would be the sort of headhunters description VPS senior people and the beauty of this more senior people is you can give them much more complex tasks build me a product division of doing this go open european markets for me and the drawback is it anyone capable of those complex conceptual abstractions necessary to do that tends also to be capable of politics and because the world is not composed of saints as an organization scales the level of internecine politics increases exponentially someone sent me the difference between a great company is one where the exact spent only twenty five percent of the time playing politics and a bad one is wet to spend fifty percent of the time punk politics and that delta is entire gaussian bell curve from the best fortune five hundred company to the worst and i think one of the things that really matters the founder is acting as a dampner on politics so would you sing into nice in warfare reducing the tendency for marketing to try and take control of the sales funnel would you sing tendency for the head of sales to want to take over sort of inbound marketing just trying to stop the CFO controlling spending so tightly that you don't get positive return capital investments by sales transtop sales getting so much control over spending that your margins gotta control all those boundary conditions between sort of VP he doesn't functional heads defining those well and managing through that transition is just so important and there's nowhere where someone who learns that through the process of entrepreneurship one of the things that i think belgium at peoples careers in general is the early stages that and the personalities going to them often have negative correlation with the later stages so if you could have sort of mckinsey or goldman sachs analyst often what they need is attention to detail strong work ethic high diligence high conscientiousness instead of by factors all those sort of things if you look at middle management at those companies they need good project management good ability to abstract and structure problems good ability to pull a team together and create team LOL and the sort of being crossed the detail in the technical knowledge matters less and then if you look at the partner level and those firms often all that matters is relationship building and sales and charm and the ability to empathize with the client and connect with them and so it's very hard to find people that are stars in all three parts of those careers and i think it's the same with entrepreneurship the street smart entrepreneur at sort of precede who can raise money with a good narrative and get energy and recruit people and sort of create a sort of sense of momentum and a speeder core is often they negatively correlated with the sort of personality that wants to put in quarterly HR reviews and QB are reporting and really make sure that the finance team is taking at a later stage and then conversely are often the entrepreneurs do very well later finally early stage capital raising hell on earth because in some ways they're so tightly gripped to reality in the slightly pessimistic to make some very good at sort of avoiding chaos often make some very bad at pitching i would love to hear your thoughts on this interesting concept that actually our mutual friend graham and i have batted around quite a lot which is this notion that term we use based on a blog post by getting rick burton is the idea of an alien founder an alien here is used as the best possible compliment to a founder where it's somebody that just has sort of what seems to be in like an unfair and privileged access to some sort of underlying substrate the thing that is going to build the business and they just kind of know what to do they have an incredible first principles mindset typically and say bill gates would be a great example of this i think bezos would be a great example of this to use obvious ones think of that idea that in some ways the absolute best founders are in some sense alien and distinctly unique people i will maybe for the socratic psych that sort of take the opposite argument and say i think one of the mistakes that win two is just sort of seeing some ever vasant genius because you're seeing people at the height of their powers you're not seeing them on the way up there's that famous clip of bezos i think in ninety nine with amazon sprayed in spray paint on the back of the office it would be really interesting if you talk to him whether he is similar to the base awesome today because in the intervening twenty years remember you've got this incredible training program for the mind the working every hour in the start up there talking with the smartest people there constantly getting new information there hiring their filing step pattern recognition of executives get so much better they've got a million failed initiatives so they have all these learnings of what not to do they've got all the things that have worked and they've seen what scale they've seen the commonality and so how much of that is sort of looking in an athlete at the peak of their performance and not seeing the ten thousand hours of practice that got them there and i could almost argue you could invert it and say what are actually the causes of mortality and how do we just avoid suffering that mortality this year and if you survived long enough maybe greatness eventually becomes you so one of the things i think that sort of is perhaps under estimated is if you want to live forever maybe don't start thinking about studies centenarians instead workout how to not die of a DUI drunk driving or anybody else smoking twenty cigarettes a day and to some extent that same in entrepreneurship is it would be amazing and of course the problem with the observation of the world is people spend a lot of time studying greatness they don't study failure they study mohammed ali then study all the heavyweight boxes at faked out after losing their first match but maybe if you study all of those you can find a commonality in their mistake maybe they will i don't know off of their chin to the opponent or something an in startups i think there are common mistakes there's unoriginal sin about capitalizing i see so many startups three to five years in still haunted by a kebab capital raise at the beginning some investors they don't want some valuation that was hopelessly dilutive and puts BCS off now often one of the things that i see call it barely well with success is how quickly they exit their first employee that doesn't fit an i think that's actually showing is are they willing enough to be disagreeable to make the company what they want and so the willingness to cross that chasm and often you're dealing with a young founders that's a major inflection point and if you don't do it that often leads to a toxic culture and bad results then there's sort of more subtle melodies like some turning things into an academic project particularly with founders with a strong academic backgrounds often deep tech and PHD 's list of generals fighting the last where they think of prestige as the currency because it is in academia and so they just think if we do amazing work and we tell the world about that amazing work good things will happen because as a holistic that did work but it means they don't engage with the revenue they don't get quite product market fit its too much or sort of ivory tower intellectual exercise or conversely do they just sort of think we get momentum we get revenue we get traction it'll work and they haven't really thought about the deep microeconomics and unit economics of a scaling company and so i almost converted and say don't study greatness study failure and workout had not to be that if you're sort of thinking of history trying to be some good aluminum poles augustus will be really really difficult not being as incompetent as caligula seems really easy and so as a practical advice not making the catastrophic mistakes and just surviving long enough feels like a good strategy there were some general somewhere that said it's not that good soldiers become veterans it's that lucky soldiers become veterans but veterans are good soldiers meaning just the luck of surviving the first few hours put you up an experience curve an icy entrepreneurs transform in those first thirty six months of leadership and management and half of it is just stay alive till you get good we've talked a little bit about recruiting someone that all of a sudden seems like half my time is spent just recruiting people in all different directions curious how early you encourage entrepreneurs to make that a major part of what they do and whether or not that effectively lasts the rest of their career if they're successful so i think the clintons window estimated precisely because in an early company people replicate themselves so because people tend to hire not so much in their own image but with their own set of biases or the initial people you hire or influence with their other hires and so you can either get this sort of upwards iterating culture of excellence or you can get this downwards iterating culture of excellence so those first few hires are utterly critical and i think people way underestimate just the sort of the math of the return which is it seems excessive to say spend a hundred hours hiring a person but if you're only high on ten people that person is ten percent of the output of your company for the next seven years if they stay but then if they hire as well they may actually contribute to ten percent of the productivity of the company for the first decade both by their own labels in the early years but also in terms of the way they themselves are coat so i think people just some underestimate the power of the math here and don't focus on bias and entrepreneurs often have going for speed and the desire to move fast and partly this is sort of come out of startup culture because of the sort of emergencies of network affect businesses where speed often really does matter but ninety nine percent of startups don't have strong network effects eighty percent of them at all maybe nineteen percent only have weak network effects and in those quality matters far more and so going slower spending an enormous amount of time picking exceptional people that are deeply synergetics exceptional in and of themselves and then have deep and meaningful synergies with the other team members creates this thing which is a sort of algebraic functional labor output and i almost think that's how you have to think in the first year how do i find amazing stand on people that are also synergetic and so my net labor output of the firm is super high and the biggest mistake i see is when their panic to hire someone 'cause they need sort of a job done and so they just go for the earliest person and then sold monarchy at the pernicious mistake is the change in higher rate based on the amount of capital available to the startup so what you notice if you go after his hiring is not consistent of a quarter by quarter basis it bulges after each capital raise for the seed seed A B and then it's attenuated almost nothing in the six months before the next capital raise so there's sort of entrepreneurs like the proverbial sailor coming into port two spends all their money and then doesn't have any months afterwards but it's in hiring and if you think about that that's absolutely insane because what's the chance that you can find saviour high ten people what's the chance you can find eight in the first ninety days that it's right found in the first ninety days and then only right to find two in the next five hundred and forty days your chance coming across the exceptional people is so much lower than if you spaced out evenly and because you'll know the existing people and see them working together if you hire two in that first quarter each next one new hire you will understand their synergies with the existing team so much more what have you seen successful founders do to make sure that when recruiting they're able to win the best candidates out there so it's one thing to be patient and spend the time to identify them you also have to hold out an attractive proposition to those very talented people who presumably have other opportunities as well so what have you learned about the best recruiters in terms of how they market the opportunity and market the firm i'll give a sort of face cynical answer and then a some more aspiration answer the cynical one is just being a labor market so the low competition you really don't want to be sitting there in san francisco trying to close your candidate when john carlson 's trying to close the candidate as the alternative 'cause johns gonna win knowing john i agree he's one of the greatest sex of his age but you see this actually happened well as if you're hiring that person in kiev and the other option is working and outsourced I T for deutsche bank it's much much easier win so in some ways what he wanted find is where are the incredibly qualified people in weekly competitive labor markets and that is a much easier filter than actually being good at the coating and a much more powerful one you much better being a heavyweight boxer is not very good fighting lightweight boxes then you are getting good as a heavyweight boxer and it's the same you're better going and competing in a market whether the other recruiters are lightweight because they're boring industrial firms with tenure based promotions so that's one and then two look it's some combination of sort of painting a vision that people want to be part of understanding what they themselves are motivated so it goes back to those sort of early questions are motivated by working with great people are they motivated by utilitarian impact and then more motivated by things like money and power it goes back to just getting the impression that they want to spend time with you do they actually want to spend every day with you as a founder 'cause these companies are small it's not like you're quoted by big company and the high on VP you maybe we spend an hour month with you're going to spend a lot of time with the founder so there has to be a natural desire to do this and then third i think there's just a sort of sense of being in a sort of gang that's going to succeed a sense of we happy few quote some shakespeare of just i want to be with this because this is going to be something that changes the world and it's going to be an adventure and fun and that cliche the journey will be the reward will be true and the economic outcome will be able board and when i look back to impact will have award and if you get that trip tech you'll close them i would love your take on the sort of interesting tension between what i'll call in the U S sort of east coast versus west coast investing where i would say east coast investing is very traditional wall street more quantitative west coast more startup ian technology more qualitative and almost cavalier about in some cases about the quantitative aspect of things i'd love you to riff on the pros and cons of these two styles and where you see the appropriate mix of them i think this is a multi part explanation for that one part i think is the absence of existing status hierarchies in the west coast meant there was less of an opportunity cost and sort of not joining goldman and you can almost do a counter history and say maybe all this story about darpa and the valley and all that is much less important than people think maybe it you just have a new country formed of seventy to one hundred million people without an existing status hierarchy you would obviously go onto the new tech to the new industry the new tech industry is obviously going to be back and so it was obvious that are sort of new country which is what the west coast was being since sort of world war two when you look at just the population numbers the west coast would obviously win that one part of it i think the second part is differences in the nature of trust and zero somnus partly because financial markets are in the traditional sense zero sum one person stock alpha is another persons negative alpha east coast investing has had this sort of sense of i need to beat the other person i need to get a deal and that has led to sort of lower trust between participants and the west coast and maybe it's sort of part of california hippie culture tradition coming in as at this very high sense of trust and if you look at sort of the convertible note if you look at the sort of letting the founder make decisions below supervision these things only emerging very high trust culture and i'm not sure you can build trillion dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture i think you don't have it you end up building something with a billion dollars and then arguing over how to sell it or how to optimize it and you don't get that sort of shouldn't say qua aspiration that you see in all the trillion market cap companies all of which are on the west coast and then i think there's some interesting little sort of cultural foibles possibly with an actual address by the east and west coast but more by the nature of investing maybe what people do as analysts between the age of twenty one and twenty three so if you spend your time between twenty one and twenty three building excel models you tend to think more about numbers and so you tend to have a much better intuition for margin economics and so where is these coast off tonight over the west and the way they look at businesses it's they collect identify businesses with shaky unit economics but faster revenue growth and good product market fit and they're like look you have product market fit but only 'cause you're giving away a hundred dollars for ninety so of course we've got good butter market bed i'll give me some counterpoint where west coast investors do very well is where you have a product we that doesn't get evinced in the numbers immediately but it's such a sort of tactile and visual experience when you use it you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers and there are two examples one is the early iphone and i was doing some investigations for microsoft at the time and it was easier to talk about competitors than talk about yourself because your left side code to say something you shouldn't so you always trying to steer the conversation to talk about apple google something and one of the things you realized is there was a bunch of investors that sort of thought apple was overvalued when it was sort of hundred hundred billion market cap because they took the time of nokia and said even if they take all nokia 's market share this business can't be big because phones only sells whatever it was back then and they couldn't into it the increase in pricing power that you were going to get from turning the phone into a computer and the west coast BC community immediately intuited that and then you see the same in this sort of almost comic battle of a tesla as a stock the apple one week and says that win on the west coast the texel story isn't fully written yet but again it's this difference from the culture that look this product is so amazing it will redefine the economics for category and investors saying when you look at this in a spreadsheet it just doesn't work and i think one interesting thing in general in the search for alpha is where do you get intuitions that are hard to make because there's no natural person to think of it there's a public company called zyla X ER though which is a small business accountant company an it's headquartered in new zealand listed on the essex its biggest market is accounting software in the UK but the people that fundamentally understand accounting software would be people that had followed into it which is a west coast stock nasdaq listed would be more than people may be looking into it that look at H and R block there maybe even going to tableau and business analytics right and so there you had a company that quietly went from fifty million market cap ten billion market cap and i'm not sure anyone intuited it because new zealand investors weren't used to take the australian investors came out of a sort of mining culture and the U S investors tended not to occur essex listed companies and so one thing that storm is trying to be smarter than other people is very hard and doesn't work they often trying to have an insight that you get because you sitting in different information fo just seems exponentially easier everything you highlight suggests exactly what's happened in the last ten years which is that the primary sin for public market investors is being overly quantitative that basically anything quantitative whether pure quantitative strategies or people that rely heavily on spreadsheets as you say have tended to get trounced by people that have the more qualitative fundamental insight about what will become a very big market i'm curious how you apply those concepts in your own style of investing at an earlier stage so where does obviously there's a lot of qualitative but where does the quantitative come to play we just go a little bit further on the thoughts around that which is i don't think it's very interesting is the way you model companies in excel with the DCF there's a sort of set of cultural norms like trending down the growth rate to a terminal value overtime that obviously were correct industrial era companies the sort of companies that are KKR would buy if you were sort of modeling nabisco and barbarians at the gate it's obviously like conceptual approach maybe that's just not like for network effect businesses because instead wittry how do you model in excel the concept of india six something becomes a standard and therefore gets sustained accelerating growth there was some sort of joke in the eighties of you'd never get fired for buying IBM well maybe in two thousand and six suddenly became you never got fired for buying salesforce dot com how do you model in that as a concept suddenly kicking into revenue growth maybe what you should be doing is writing this sort of three thousand word essay on revenue growth drivers as opposed to sort of trending it down overtime as an automatic default so there's sort of certain things where i think the industrial era protocols actually just mislead you conversely i think the counterpoint to that which is the sort of two product driven mistake is when you look for network effects everywhere and you sort of assume they exist and actually you're just getting into it standard competitive market trying to turn that to start investing i think a very good rule of thumb is to think it's very hard to extract economic lengths to get revenue without solving someone 's problem so go right back to sort of jeremy bentham utilitarianism why are you making people happier how much happier are you making them and what percent of that can you extract as economic surplus and what percent goes to them so an interesting honestly pick and google there's lots of charts saying people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars for search yeah google 's ad revenue ARPU per person is much lower so potentially the utilitarian output of google is ten X maybe even twenty X the economic value derived from that was imagine if you looked at something like oracle you would actually find the utilitarian benefits the economics are much higher percentage of the utilitarian benefits like there's more value capture as a percentage of the total some commonweal created the total common utility but i think even when you're talking to a company that seed you can sort of start to have that conversation over how big apartment you solving how many people are you solving that for or how much money you have those institutions got to spend on your product if it's in the enterprise and then if that's the utility created that's part one how big is that and then two is what are the competitive dynamics in this marketplace so how much of that utility would you capture and how much will just be given to your customers as consumer surplus and one of the sort of interesting wonderful tragedies the economy over the last four years is there are so many companies where a hundred and ten percent of the economic energy passed over to consumer surplus so you just had massive increases in living standards sort of accidental wikipedia 's so there's really strange examples like LCD televisions everyone switched from cathode tube to LCD in the early two thousands that's an increasing utility but no TV companies made money because the market is too competitive same with things like improvements in consumer modems routers switches you don't see two hundred billion market cap lauter companies like intel but we all benefit from far faster speeds than we did twenty years ago and so what you're looking for as an investor is high utilitarian outcome and the ability to capture it are there markers of that latter piece the ability to catch it that you see again and again that interests you most extreme is obsolete network effects must have to get these in marketplaces you get men think the classics metcalf law you get some examples where total company over today you combined data from other companies to generate insights so each time you get a new customer you improve the product for all the existing customers because you get a bigger data set to work up strangely i think spotting them has less use than spotting the fallacy 's if we go to data there's an amazing sort of the last gasp of the company whose unit in the economics don't work is the values in the data and ninety nine percent of the times that isn't true and the idea is that you've got unique data set that's going to be incredibly value maybe for advertisers maybe for other customers made for enterprises because of the insights would be generated but it actually turns out most datasets will get the same insight and people there was once a company i dentist responsible but they said it if you gave the last five browsing sites in some been two or their last five latitude lanja tude locations in real space or the last five google search terms although last five credit card purchases you could basically get to the same level of activity on that person 's predicted behavior which means there's a sort of false milaje oven oasis which is this can be found in the data and it turns out to be large 'cause there's so many other ways to get to that answer and so half the time what they're looking for is sort of the exact opposite it's where it appears there should be value capture but there won't be i asked once a group of people what if any specific sector category of companies they would invest in if they could only choose one for the rest of their career and one person said communications because you'll always have some monopoly to pick from which is sort of a classic expression of the network effect idea i'll go for if you pick two axes one called access is boredom and the other is complexity you want highly bowling and highly complex because everything in the universe is supply and demand curve and you just get insufficient supply of entrepreneurs in the highly bowling but highly compact space and therefore you get elevated returns so if you go through the quadrants you've sort of got the whole simple side bowling and simple and complex and simple it's just too hard to get differentiation without enough complexity that's when you get commoditisation if you go for interesting and complex you get burned entrepreneurs this is problem with space tech as an area of innovation every single person involved with space is basically a blunt genius who's passionate about their work and loves it and so very very strong competitive dynamics on the other hand if you hang out in audit software accounting software you're sitting in an area that's complex but no one wants to post they do it at a dinner party and what you might call this sort of spill it rewards of the industry lower and therefore you just get less five entrepreneurs therefore the transfer be entrepreneurs succeeding is significantly higher do you think that two by two matrix squares with say the trillion dollar club today of amazon and apple and some of the fang stocks do you think that they generally were at their start board no i think it would more work in this sort of case of salesforce work day tableau datadog all those classic enterprise SAS names i think the truly exceptional ones are so idiot syncratic there's no way to find them because if they were predictable you would get some competition they won't exist interesting when you say it google how many failed search companies preceded them alta vista excite lycos infoseek ask jeeves imagine that someone sent you something about google when it was a small company you would say oh it's just another search engine in some ways you almost need the opposite you need a case for why it was so obvious if you can early facebook there's all these comments and but showing my space is already won this market i think the exceptions are just so exceptional you can't formulate rules for them i think it's the next year down where there's probably more reputable behavior of the four hundred and eighty three angel investments that you've made what percent would you say are clearly boring to whom would be the sort of counter question i think to sort of the average person probably three hundred and fifty of them obviously they're not pulling to the founder an they never boring to me i find things like accounting software deeply interesting because it's an intellectual puzzle you're solving some problem and i also think the utilitarian output to the world is way under estimated these things if you were to think what was the precursor technology to manhattan sewers play heart of manhattan without sewers but they don't sound exciting right if you were to suddenly will move them human living standards would drop exponentially and so those base technologies that sort of double entry accounting in the sort of fourteenth century under the medici 's or whoever those things really matter as sort of system wide improvements to the thing and sometimes the joy of those can be missed before we started recording you mentioned this interesting word which you don't often hear and investing which is aesthetics i'd love you to talk a bit about mister aesthetics why they matter and why they may create bias i think this is thing where if you think about the investment career most people join a place where they fit and so they join an organization that gets them so you do have this sort of birds of a feather flock together so you tend to find that you get a set of people that either like the gritty and the real and the physical tangible look at say the overlap between stock investors looking at things like mining companies and shipping companies and then you get people that like the abstract and the deathly ill and the sort of conceptual think of atlas ian stripe companies of that till then once all this tweet some joke about that investors that they were only things with names like american asbestos and it made me chuckle 'cause it seemed that there was some sort of truth for that it felt gritty and truer more wheel and more like just better to own something that's a steel mill pompton pitts burg than it is to own a tableau or some company doing this sort of weird software stuff and so the instinct read about that is does that create biases and oversights so maybe becausw VC sort of in the twenty ten to twenty thirteen twenty fourteen network effect consumer businesses were so good maybe too much capital went into those in the subsequent years i think of like shannon scooters and things like that because there wasn't enough darwinian survival of people that focused on unit economics those partners have diminished in their political power within the VC organization versus the partners the bat more on a network effect on the product then that's a chapter in dawkins sort of selfish gene on hawks and doves and evolutionary stable populations of different behavioral strategies and maybe that also replicates in investors and of course as an investment type succeeds so it attracts more capital and more disciples and therefore there's more people looking for it and therefore the alpha is more diminished we've talked a lot about the founders and characters of entrepreneurs less so about characteristics of investors that you've worked with or seen operate what are your observations there probably haven't processed four hundred and eighty three of them in the same way but i'm sure you've been around them what do you think makes for the right mix success is very idiosyncratic rather like entrepreneurs it's sort of finding the fit for their style so i know one investor at siege the fantastic investor and just has an absolute essence of getting to the nub of the character of an entrepreneur just the descriptions the articulation strength the weaknesses you would have thought should spend two hundred hours doing the psychological profile it's sort of like those TV shows where you have someone profile the seal killed in like thirty seconds it's almost sort of a gift but then there's another investor at the same stage who almost ignores the person after founder in is all about the structural economics of the business the market power that ability to capture value and both styles work beautifully and then i've seen a third type almost doesn't think about the underlying company what they actually watch is other investors and sort of like a pack of lions they don't try and kill the antelope they just steal the ant work once that's down and they just swoop in and win deals they saw other good investors go for so silly wildly different strategies all three i've seen work superbly and so no cookie cutter solution i'd love to hear your take on the effects that kovid now three four months into it are having on the world at large both from a company standpoint for societal standpoint and at what point sort of the behaviors that have changed become very set and in some way permanently change how we live i see two main effects one is this sort of tech acceleration you've got this shift in behaviors that would have happened only over the long term from demographics as a sociologist at microsoft who once said look there's a thing called the nineteen seventy five which is people born before that just never had computers at school and so will never have the same intuitive behaviors as people born after that and it's sort of a mummy of the einstein or maybe it's einstein comment of science advances one funeral at a time and so in some ways the natural movement progress is as generations of people get older video games of classic example of this it was seen as something only for kids until those kids grow older and kept on doing it i think covid has changed that because what you've had is seventy and eighty year olds get on and you zoom and use digital apps in a way that was much more kim twenty five builds that's a permanent one off shift and you will see it in the numbers for all E commerce startups every E commerce startup the numbers have gone insane to the point where start wondering whether they've made a mistake because it can't be that good you can't get that faster acceleration but no it really is that fast acceleration and my guess is the emotional experience of retail will just be less appealing than it was and so even in a world of reopening my guess is you get this continued elevation of ecommerce and then once people have shifted from doing some activity like going to a bar to playing some video game competitively probably a bigger percent of that will stick and seems obvious because this is lasted long enough that you get habit formation it certainly longer than thirty days that's for moments take then there's a much more subtle impact which is you've definitely had globalization of investing one of the things that i never made any sense to me was investors that define themselves by geography so they were in berlin and invested in companies and building because the commonality in running a startup by geography seems almost de minimas where's the commonality of say fintech globally seems much more similar to each other or quantum computing startups globally seems much more similar than icon computing company and a credit card company both within a few streets of each other so always seemed more logical to me for startups to be defined by functional earlier than by geography and that's starting to happen because if you're doing szum calls with someone there's no difference whether there a mile away from you or a thousand miles away and then the same with the labor force startups are starting to do remote in a way that was inconceivable before and what it started to do is make me think very deeply about where they can find talented people maybe i'm too optimistic but i think that may just lead to a permanent shift in overall productivity upwards because you're putting together a team not defined by the accidents of geography but defined by finding the best people you can anywhere in the world and if everyone does that you just have a bigger sort of quiddity in every type of output and that leads to just a massively higher output function what are these changes and sort of demographics and the way we live now it does seem that there's likely to be some sort of city to suburban transition an one of the things i like to do is sort of i think history is really useful investing because i hit one of the mistakes you can make as a sort of temple arrogance thinking that i'm one who lives through is sort of overly unique there's a book by will durant called season christman it's sort of whole history of loan from the founding two five hundred E and sort of the fourth roman christianity afterwards so he didn't think how would you invest through that did you buy or sell lumina lyla state when caesar's murdered 'cause you get a civil war you get chaos but then you get augustus and peace afterwards then when you get this whole spate of bad emperors and it looks like everything is going to fall apart maybe you would sell and then you get the space in trajan hadrian good employees and get a great hundred years like what makes you think about sort of volatility and about having to make informations with only the information available at that time and what's interesting is you do get this sort of pattern of going from power and sort of fashion being to have your base in the city of rome to being out in kapalua or out in the smaller provinces out on it with the states and that cycle seems to go exist for like five hundred years of history and if you look at london i think the peak population was in the nineteen thirties i think it's still higher than the present population or it may just a peaked so maybe there's the beginning of one of these great forty year demographic changes where people move back to the suburbs or not this is speculation i certainly don't have as much conviction on it as i do on startup stuff what do you make on the other end of that barbell so certainly agree that the far off collaboration is probably going to permanently change i've seen it happen just personally in many examples where now you don't care where the person is zooming in from it opens up an enormous pool of talent and you seem ridiculous for not having tried to tap that earlier the other extreme would be like hyper local what i've also noticed is the middle is gone new york city for me which is fifteen minutes away is way less relevant but my town is now way more relevant and the people in it do you think there's investing portunity there or i would just be curious for any thoughts you have on kind of the local community versus the distance zoom i'm sadly out of insight on it but i think you're intuitively right in predicting the outcome i think one of the things that's going to be barely interesting is i do think there's a sort of you shape curve where for companies you either have to be remote or do you have to be centralized the bit that's going to be absolutely nightmarish is if you have a hybrid mix because what that'll lead to is everyone at headquarters will have a political advantage over everyone that works remotely and so you'll end up promoting people who chose to move to headquarters rather than worked remotely so you'll end up promoting the more politically aware which is probably the most toxic criteria you could have for long term productivity of the firm as a quick aside sarah told me to ask you about crypto an farmland and i'm curious if those were meant to be topics that are grouped together in your mind or separate and of course i'm interested in your thoughts on both crypto is super interesting because it's so un analogous to anything that's come before it so one of the interesting things with investing is people get a dopamine effect from things they've made money on before and so they like to invest in similar things or at least things that their friends made money before so they think there will be a dopamine hit foot so if you look at decks and start up from twenty sixteen you would be amazed how often the uber of or air B and B of appear as sort of marketing ploys to serve almost say you're going to get the dopamine effect investing the business that is similar to these existing successes once every so often you get something that just sort of has no epistemological pliers there's just nothing like it before and i think crypto has that and then what's so interesting about crypto is it has such strong psychological golf shafts tests so the biggest variable i've seen amongst people i know of whether they believe something like a bitcoin is viable is age in a way that i don't see for any other element tech younger people find digital money more intuitive older people find it less so there may also be something subtle there about the strength of the nation state then U S investors find it less intuitive than on U S investors because they think of the U S government say banning crypto like FDR confiscated gold and so they think of it as unlikely whereas if you're from a country like belgium it's less obvious that your government really has the capability to do something like ban crypto so all these strange variables like the size of the country you're in and the government capability affect your conception of its viability and then it's also interesting within crypto itself that you have these two major platforms bitcoin ethereum and they sort of attract different investor types so bitcoins got the sort of association almost with austrian monetary policy with some gold with preservation of value with this sort of very trust minimized sort of slightly dark slightly almost gothic view of humanity and sort of bitcoin as a sort of place greater safety wells helium is much more sort of visually about defy changing stuff much more software much more network effects much less consciousness of trust and store value and you start to see the sort of bickering between those two cultures and it's fascinating how you've got to sort of shilling points of showing points not only are they showing points at the economic level but also showing points for investor personality types that go into them what's interesting is if they continue to do that they probably diverge far enough that there's no longer in fact any competition between them because they've diverged so much culture in aspiration 's there no longer direct competitors one of the things that sort of entropy is how is wealth preserved overtime and if you look at one of the best stores of value it was forestry and there's two very interesting attributes forestry one is it's so boring no one ever bothers to seize it so if you look at people that were in a country on the wrong side of the war and occupied by an invading power over the last two thousand years things like houses and artworks were confiscated things that businesses for nationalized no one ever thought about forestry it just sort of slid under the later and then the second interesting attribute of it was that the cash flow characteristics so tellable you have to wait fifty years for trees to go you got very few investors and very few corporations doing it because imagine building an excel model showing a payback in fifty one years that's really sort of only two to three percent of your principle it's so appalling you never go into it and therefore it had these characteristics work a superbly well it's sort of interesting to think what are the digital equivalents of things that have some psychological appellants to them and therefore actually will have great economic capture becauses something unappealing about them what do you think the best examples of that last concept our digital equivalents of repel an asset i think certainly up till twenty seventeen script over that it was such a strange topic the association with things like mount box and forward and things just made it slightly sketchy and then the abstractions that the lack of physical reality of it i think makes it unintuitive people you can't touch it can't feel it it's sort of numbers in the sky things like that just don't have psychological appeal in the absence of psychological appeal is a source of alpha what do you think the most misvalued asset in the world is today i would say it's probably entrepreneurs in markets that are non obvious and i don't mean because their end market is not obvious it's people addressing global problems but in some secondary city in romania because capital markets at that stage is not efficient enough to find them as a famous company UI path i think now worth about ten billion that came out of a mania and some visit powder matic example of that i think if you were to say where is there a cool option it's probably something in crypto it may exist or it may not exist i think one of the questions is is everything in that space now alta vista exciting local space or is it at the google and amazon stage it's a very very hard question to answer in full sight irritatingly obvious in hindsight but it does seem there's a probability mass of something being very big there because there's something about finance where it's demarcated by nation state even though it's a pure electron good and so anything that's just pure numbers in the sky should actually be globally scalable but it isn't because of the existing finance regular environment and the existing historical paths sort of banks when they were physical institutions that makes me think this globalization of finance has the potential for multiple trillion dollar market cap companies over the next decades you mentioned romania which just makes me think of europe more broadly speaking i'd be curious your relative take an opportunity in europe for business and investing when the last decade has been relatively underwhelming certainly relative to the performance of U S companies it is amazing that if you look at the top ten maybe in the top twenty by now companies in the world by market cap there exclusively U S and china there's an absolutely fascinating staten says so much about the last thirty years there's a very sort of dark kind of thought which says one of the best things about europe is that you probably have a less geopolitical risk than any other place there's something about the horrors of salman vadon and stalingrad that makes it some unimaginable for germany and france to have a conflict well as i think it is much more imaginable to have china india U S those some countries have conflict so in some ways one of the things you have in europe is a sort of absence of systemic risk of wipeout 'cause if you look at what we really destroys investing returns its geopolitical conflict if you look at the collapse of european wealth in world war one world war two it's just absolutely epic and i think that maybe an underpriced benefit of europe i think the other much more cheerful practical one is their countries institutions weren't developed enough to build a google arguably that's every other country apart from the U S but i think it is certainly true of very small european countries because they just don't have the complexity of legal system they don't obviously means becoming public they don't have the institutional norms or the depth of financing or anything like that but now i see so many companies come out of europe the delaware corporations LLC 's that have say west coast you investors the legal documents by wilson cencini or some other U S firm and you have this amazing mix of sort of soviet quality education which is very high in math and logic post soviet GDP per head which basically means your capital goes very far when honda labor force but with U S high trust institutions acting to sort of scale it as a corporation and that unique coming together feel special it's a fascinating take on everything i mean i had never considered really any of those angles again appealing to the four hundred and eighty three companies that you've invested in i'd love to know the geographic dispersion of those things generally speaking almost an even mix between U S U K continental europe would account for ninety percent with domain ten scattered twin asia africa latin america with a particular hub in singapore 'cause when incubator called entrepreneurs first that i invest with a great deal you've had made on the show which was a fantastic episode i love his idea of the history of the technology of ambition it's completely maps IP which was it's very interesting to think where counted people go as a framework and so if you go back and go the other way and say what can you learn from investing when you look at history it's interesting think is an under estimated cause of the decline of some institution not all the stuff people think about when they wrote about it but just that very talented people who are young tries to go a different direction so there was a time when you're a young man and you can choose do i go and do and administration of roman province or do i join the early christian church possibly the talent started to flow towards the church and away for moments tutions and actually caused weakening that is a generalized framework of where exceptional challenges to go super interesting so one thought that occurs in our world is perhaps the sort of investment banks and consulting firms in all forms of tomorrow will be much less good than their precursors twenty thirty years ago because so many talented people going into entrepreneurship and that talent has to pull out of somewhere now i think again from a sort of societal viewpoint i think putting bad times people in things that can scale their products to millions of people is higher utility than putting them in affectively high-end artisane profession like consulting the law where the output doesn't scale it seems to me that a lot of what you're doing with your life and career is curation of people ideas companies history i mean so many different examples in our conversation today i'd love you to riff on that idea of curation and whether or not it's going to become an increasingly important skill in a world that is exploding with information and content and data very simply is if you think back to sort of thirty years ago your basic problem is lack of information so you sort of read about capital markets investors in the nineties and they're reading sec filings so leading sell side reports they're trying to get time with management but it's a fundamental lack of information problem now you look at the massive growth of available information and i think it becomes much more filtering problem and in some ways the best way to filter is to have second stage filters before your filter which is just to find amazing people and use them as filter points so there's a sort of phase which is if you hang out with people smarter harder working an molly better than oneself you always live in a funnel of positive serendipity because affectively you're dragged upwards to the mean benchmark which is higher than oneself so that's what i try to do you just described my whole life i'm playing with this idea now of it's better to be interested than interesting and as someone that's never been particularly interesting a great way to eventually become interesting is to be purely interested all the time yes hundred percent and i think i tricked you could overlay amazing people in a unique configuration you get an information flow that is both a creative to view it pulls you up but is also a unique lens in the world and from unique lenses you get unique opportunities by that you just mean nonoverlapping kind of backgrounds and areas of interest in the people in your network yeah i'm one of the ones that i think is always fascinates me is just part of geographically disparate networks often you get these very sort of tight communities in some ways the valley in some ways sort of new york say the hedge fund community and sometimes the most obvious insights are just from going between one to the other and just seeing the difference in worldviews in stark relief from each other and so i sort of think about that constantly i mean one of the ones that's most powerful is just thinking farmer say imagine think about the same problem not from the U S perspective but from say i finished perspective on albanian perspective and suddenly topics look very very different and there's a danger of defaulting to this because of U S is sort of the world hegemon to defaulting to that mindset and that's not always the best most predicted view we've talked about a lot and as we wind down i'm curious what topic that we haven't talked about at all you are most interested in of course after we finish this i'll think of tons but i'm sort of failing to think of anything in the moment i think it is one i would pick it would be one of the things that sort of fascinating in sort of this trip tech is how much startups are temple inevitabilities so as a phase someone said to me what's the difference between a hella tic under profit in tech the hell it it gets burned to the stake you know the profit becomes famous about two years and you sometimes wonder how much timing matters was a site like pinterest always going to exist within a year that you could download a page of images on the internet in under a hundred number settings was that the sort of temporal inevitability of a product like that and is it the same for most products was GPS and mobile phone did that make an uber like thing inevitable in around two thousand nine two thousand and ten one of the great unknowns is the temple one and then i think the other sort of great unknown is how much a value is actually created for the top layers of the stack by the bottom layers that don't capture it so are we all just the beneficiaries is angel investing pure the beneficiary of the emergency WS measure 'cause i can tell story whereby angel investing just didn't exist because it was negative although i see because you had spent so much in sun microsystems servers and sort of physical equipment you just had poor R across the whole industry then a WS in azure come along and critically as a startup you don't know your own future demand curve because you don't know when you're gonna get on market fit so you either have to buy too many servers in which case west capital or too few in which case you couldn't demand was with a WS measure they've effectively taken that risk out of the equation and you can almost know that your cost base only scales with your success is the entire industry just sitting on that i kind of in an intuitive field it probably is better luck and good maybe we get an AI boom in the next couple of years maybe that would be written about as that bike do some email maybe it's actually nvidia 's ampere chips and the emergence of five and seven nanometer nodes just drive improvements in throughput that drives emele up so it's nothing to do with the companies that are actually working on it it's to do with sort of the pickaxe is being turned from wood to iron making their work far more efficient and but nvidia will probably capture some value of that but probably won't capture the greater value same if you were to do i sort of history of early computing the nineties and two thousands be interesting to write it from the importance of the evolution of intel chips and modem speeds as the primary drivers as opposed to the mallet of history but both these great companies will charlie i feel like i could do this with you almost weekly basis and he sort of endlessly entertained by your prolific interest in so many different things i'll certainly remember this conversation is one that's a reminder that investing in business are complicated and if you want to spend your career in those spaces you better love it because there are so many variables in so many things happening and you have to develop your own niche in your own strategy my closing question for everybody in each of these conversations is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone 's ever done for you oh my god there are so many there are so so many examples i think it's probably a recurrent one of often my enthusiasm has been greater than my competence and it's the people that bet on the enthusiasm more than the competence and internally grateful to them i love that again you're sometimes describing my life so i know exactly what you mean and it is a wonderful thing and major category of these answers is betting on somebody early seeing something in them and taking that risk is always a great kindness will try this has been a highlight of my early week even though it's just monday i really

former head of strategy at microsoft and a prolific investor having personally invested in nearly 500 companies through his careeer i met charlie at an event hosted in new york and you can tell within one minute of meeting him that his mind is sparkling with ideas and curiosity it's no wonder he's been among the most commonly requested guests when i asked several top investors in ceos who i should have on the show we discuss the lessons he's learned about business investing in people from such a large sample size of companies i won't reveal anymore here i highly recommend you just listen to charlie and learn let's dive in charlie i like starting these things in a unique way an one idea that you've had is to have people stack rank their vices of power money and fame i help you to begin by explaining why you're interested in this idea and what you've learned from the answers over the years so it's a two part question one is the virtues which is working with people you like working on amazing problems and having impact and then the three vices power money and fame and you can't avoid them they have to be stacked going to separately an it's really trying to get at the differences between there's no good answer but there are definite good fit answers so someone who's interested in power tends to be better at execution someone's more interested in money tends to think more about some capital efficiency i tend to avoid people interested in fame but if you are doing something in showbiz it would presumably be the number one criteria if you think about the different streams sort of impact intellectual interest working with people you really get impression of where people are going to be happy and where they're not going to be happy you also start to understand why certain organizations do so well so spacex if you think about it stacks high unhealthily it's interesting that you're working with amazing people in your huge utilitarian impact in the world whereas if you're working sent fintech you're less likely to sort of that utilitarian positive impact any especially memorable or interesting series of answers that you've gotten on the two stack ranks that come to mind a lot of people have negative utility from fame alot of people start with power and then when you push them it's actually money but they don't want to say it and that's more true outside of the US culture than it is in the US it's particularly true with europeans and so a lot of it is trying to get people to actually say what they truly believe as opposed to say what they think they should say i'm curious in what context whether it be interviewing perspective founders interviewing central hires or others you find it most interesting and useful all of the above the founder one is fascinating could you actually end up going down different lines and helping them depending on whether they answer the power and the money founders advance with power tend to need help more on managing their startup capital efficiently they tend to be the ones that spend more they tend to be the ones that over expand their often too aggressive converse with the ones that answer money tend to be very capital efficient but often slightly too cautious slightly under aggressive sometimes not willing enough to stamp their authority on the company and make it the culture that it needs to be to be successful when it comes to hiring or evaluating founders apart from this two part stack ranking are there other favorite questions or devices that you return to again and again i think what you're looking for is founder market fit i think there's a sort of mistaken concept that does protonic ideal of an entrepreneur and i think maybe there's two basic things there's energy in this sort of cognitive ability but after that you're really looking for fit so if you take the sort of prototypical consumer founder they tend to have more empathy for how people behave well as if you take the classic enterprise founder they tend to be more national because in some ways you can just go and ask your customers what features do you want and go build them and so you go down those different lines and i think there's a lot of fallacy in that sort of atomic ideal what you're actually looking for is someone who is a good fit for business i'd like to take a step back now and introduce you to the audience a little bit 1 device that i've been using with people on the podcast is to ask you to give the thumbnail 2 minutes sketch of your life and career up until this point studied politics first with economics at oxford ended up very briefly mckinsey then at microsoft and then sort of mumbled my way and becoming an investor and do a lot of angel investing so i think i've done about 500 angel investments like the actual numbers 483 and about 300 in the portfolio at the moment i believe you ran strategy at microsoft what exactly did that entail and what is most memorable about that time this so many memories working with amazing people the hostile acquisition of yahoo as an attempt was just unbelievably into actually fascinating trying to buy a company in 12 stack position for i think it's 47 billion dollars and just the drama and the soap opera and realizing how much path dependency matters and big deals how much are casual comment misinterpreted by one side or the other actually changes the outcome it's remarkable how little system theory there is in the sense of if you an experiment so again and again i think you would get a lot of different results in M and a activity wells and things like product usage good products and bad product would probably be the same in each experiment 483 investments is a crazy amount i want to come back to your time at microsoft probably later on and talk in more depth about strategy but given the sheer volume of investments that you made i think a great place to begin our conversation is your idea or your thinking around why startups succeed and fail i'd love to begin by you outlining sort of what if anything is shared in common across those 483 so are there certain features that you're always looking for and sort of how your process works and then we'll get into the success and failure of startups in some ways to tie together so i think the dominant sort of failure mode for startups is the same at each different stage so that sort of pre seed to seed you basically have a failure to achieve labor productivity which is really just a polite way of saying the team doesn't come together doesn't gel and produce good output usually a team that just produces good work or generate enough sort of kinetic energy to get continuing funding once you sort of going from seed to series a it's another single cause which is how to get product market fit you're basically on the search for demand curve and you either find 1 where you don't find one and this is where you've got the highest element of pure chance in the startup it's always feels akin to sort of gold prospecting in the california gold rush which is you can be good or you can be bad you can do the right thing you can do the wrong thing but there's some elusive amanda chance the why is this perspector with the best maps and the most intelligent strategy sometimes just won't find it and someone will just fall asleep put the pan in the stream some golden come out and there really is a little nexos of serendipity at this stage then when you move to series a it's really all about labor productivity but in a different form it's can the manager scale and one of the fallacy's is most early stage startup founders think their managers and they're actually not what they have is a team that's actually managing them 'cause when you're managing say 10 or less people and you're spending time with them everyday what's actually happening is there managing you buy influence because they know you well enough and they talked to enough to work out what your desires are so as long as you're articulate and energetic and sort of engaged you actually don't have to manage the team managers you up but when you scale to 30 people to 90 people above you no longer have those personal connections and you have to move to formal management techniques and that's i can sort of fermi paradox great filter it wipes out an amazing amount of startups and the way that's divins tis a collapse in the labor productivity per person there's a term in microeconomics good managerial dis economies of scale and i think in some ways the angle of the decline of productivity per person is the difference between sort of the stripes the great startups and the failures and maybe if you're great start up as you go from 10 people to 100 people output per person drops 15 and if you're a bad start up it actually drops over 90 with the result that often 100 people startups produce arrest and they did when they had 10 people because the managerial collapse has been so extreme and wonder somethings if you get this comedy skit by big maybe there's a sort of interesting explanation where more than the shared attributes was an instinct for the sort of structures and processes and management that were shared between gates sucker burg basals the color things all these sort of super counter people because my guess is they didn't receive form instruction on it there be season advisors want that help form it it may be either by chance or by skill they just intuitive their way through it then when you get beyond that sort of series B and beyond i think it's institution building interesting problems is sort of people that become entrepreneurs are often full of energy and sort of flexibility or mr sort of combination of street smart and book smart but there's a point where they've hit product market fit were actually what they're doing is repeating a process at scale and tucupita process at scale you need to build an institution and often that sort of is almost an automatic to their personality if you're going to take in revenue from 40 two countries you really need a well developed finance department once you get to a certain size you will always be in court cases because of being sued by ex employees you have patent infringement suits you'll be debt collecting customers didn't pay like the shift to sort of building an institution with institutional norms institutional values for institutional culture and all the boring stuff of buildings from finance department strong legal department from HR department that again is a big filter and so those are sort of filters by stages what symptoms some of those you can do when you submit some precede wondering if this would close my eyes and they can't imagine this person on a public company conference call remembering the let's put in the microsoft as a microsoft learning schools and i'm thinking can i imagine them sitting as a sort of SEO next CFO talking with all the sort of most reactive analysts and the buy side and the phone and just be incredible enough and deep enough mature enough to pull that off it's a fascinating set of framing the one that jumps out as maybe most interesting to me is this idea of the declining curve of peoples productivity and in your experience whether or not that is something that is typically in eight to the founder meaning they just handle that naturally and with the plum or if instead it's something perhaps that could be coached and if it's really just a set of best practices that are fairly universal that founders just don't get i think the irony is it is absolutely something that can and should be coached but often isn't so often the people that get it intuitively other people that survive but there's no need for that it can just be coached in and i think a lot of it is you get this very strong transition when your voice will start up most of the people you're employing just come in and do their job and go home and the drawback of that is you tend to end up having to do type management alot of micro management and the beauty of it is you tend to get available level politics within the organization then you get this transition to wear your hiring people that are sort of execs would be the sort of headhunters description VPS senior people and the beauty of this more senior people is you can give them much more complex tasks build me a product division of doing this go open european markets for me and the drawback is it anyone capable of those complex conceptual abstractions necessary to do that tends also to be capable of politics and because the world is not composed of saints as an organization scales the level of internecine politics increases exponentially someone sent me the difference between a great company is 1 where the exact spent only 25 of the time playing politics and a bad one is wet to spend 50 of the time punk politics and that delta is entire gaussian bell curve from the best fortune 500 company to the worst and i think one of the things that really matters the founder is acting as a dampner on politics so would you sing into nice in warfare reducing the tendency for marketing to try and take control of the sales funnel would you sing tendency for the head of sales to want to take over sort of inbound marketing just trying to stop the CFO controlling spending so tightly that you don't get positive return capital investments by sales transtop sales getting so much control over spending that your margins gotta control all those boundary conditions between sort of VP he doesn't functional heads defining those well and managing through that transition is just so important and there's nowhere where someone who learns that through the process of entrepreneurship one of the things that i think belgium at peoples careers in general is the early stages that and the personalities going to them often have negative correlation with the later stages so if you could have sort of mckinsey or goldman sachs analyst often what they need is attention to detail strong work ethic high diligence high conscientiousness instead of by factors all those sort of things if you look at middle management at those companies they need good project management good ability to abstract and structure problems good ability to pull a team together and create team LOL and the sort of being crossed the detail in the technical knowledge matters less and then if you look at the partner level and those firms often all that matters is relationship building and sales and charm and the ability to empathize with the client and connect with them and so it's very hard to find people that are stars in all three parts of those careers and i think it's the same with entrepreneurship the street smart entrepreneur at sort of precede who can raise money with a good narrative and get energy and recruit people and sort of create a sort of sense of momentum and a speeder core is often they negatively correlated with the sort of personality that wants to put in quarterly HR reviews and QB are reporting and really make sure that the finance team is taking at a later stage and then conversely are often the entrepreneurs do very well later finally early stage capital raising hell on earth because in some ways they're so tightly gripped to reality in the slightly pessimistic to make some very good at sort of avoiding chaos often make some very bad at pitching i would love to hear your thoughts on this interesting concept that actually our mutual friend graham and i have batted around quite a lot which is this notion that term we use based on a blog post by getting rick burton is the idea of an alien founder an alien here is used as the best possible compliment to a founder where it's somebody that just has sort of what seems to be in like an unfair and privileged access to some sort of underlying substrate the thing that is going to build the business and they just kind of know what to do they have an incredible first principles mindset typically and say bill gates would be a great example of this i think bezos would be a great example of this to use obvious ones think of that idea that in some ways the absolute best founders are in some sense alien and distinctly unique people i will maybe for the socratic psych that sort of take the opposite argument and say i think one of the mistakes that win two is just sort of seeing some ever vasant genius because you're seeing people at the height of their powers you're not seeing them on the way up there's that famous clip of bezos i think in 99 with amazon sprayed in spray paint on the back of the office it would be really interesting if you talk to him whether he is similar to the base awesome today because in the intervening 20 years remember you've got this incredible training program for the mind the working every hour in the start up there talking with the smartest people there constantly getting new information there hiring their filing step pattern recognition of executives get so much better they've got a million failed initiatives so they have all these learnings of what not to do they've got all the things that have worked and they've seen what scale they've seen the commonality and so how much of that is sort of looking in an athlete at the peak of their performance and not seeing the 10000 hours of practice that got them there and i could almost argue you could invert it and say what are actually the causes of mortality and how do we just avoid suffering that mortality this year and if you survived long enough maybe greatness eventually becomes you so one of the things i think that sort of is perhaps under estimated is if you want to live forever maybe don't start thinking about studies centenarians instead workout how to not die of a DUI drunk driving or anybody else smoking 20 cigarettes a day and to some extent that same in entrepreneurship is it would be amazing and of course the problem with the observation of the world is people spend a lot of time studying greatness they don't study failure they study mohammed ali then study all the heavyweight boxes at faked out after losing their first match but maybe if you study all of those you can find a commonality in their mistake maybe they will i don't know off of their chin to the opponent or something an in startups i think there are common mistakes there's unoriginal sin about capitalizing i see so many startups three to five years in still haunted by a kebab capital raise at the beginning some investors they don't want some valuation that was hopelessly dilutive and puts BCS off now often one of the things that i see call it barely well with success is how quickly they exit their first employee that doesn't fit an i think that's actually showing is are they willing enough to be disagreeable to make the company what they want and so the willingness to cross that chasm and often you're dealing with a young founders that's a major inflection point and if you don't do it that often leads to a toxic culture and bad results then there's sort of more subtle melodies like some turning things into an academic project particularly with founders with a strong academic backgrounds often deep tech and PHD's list of generals fighting the last where they think of prestige as the currency because it is in academia and so they just think if we do amazing work and we tell the world about that amazing work good things will happen because as a holistic that did work but it means they don't engage with the revenue they don't get quite product market fit its too much or sort of ivory tower intellectual exercise or conversely do they just sort of think we get momentum we get revenue we get traction it'll work and they haven't really thought about the deep microeconomics and unit economics of a scaling company and so i almost converted and say don't study greatness study failure and workout had not to be that if you're sort of thinking of history trying to be some good aluminum poles augustus will be really really difficult not being as incompetent as caligula seems really easy and so as a practical advice not making the catastrophic mistakes and just surviving long enough feels like a good strategy there were some general somewhere that said it's not that good soldiers become veterans it's that lucky soldiers become veterans but veterans are good soldiers meaning just the luck of surviving the first few hours put you up an experience curve an icy entrepreneurs transform in those first thirty six months of leadership and management and half of it is just stay alive till you get good we've talked a little bit about recruiting someone that all of a sudden seems like half my time is spent just recruiting people in all different directions curious how early you encourage entrepreneurs to make that a major part of what they do and whether or not that effectively lasts the rest of their career if they're successful so i think the clintons window estimated precisely because in an early company people replicate themselves so because people tend to hire not so much in their own image but with their own set of biases or the initial people you hire or influence with their other hires and so you can either get this sort of upwards iterating culture of excellence or you can get this downwards iterating culture of excellence so those first few hires are utterly critical and i think people way underestimate just the sort of the math of the return which is it seems excessive to say spend 100 hours hiring a person but if you're only high on 10 people that person is 10 of the output of your company for the next seven years if they stay but then if they hire as well they may actually contribute to 10 of the productivity of the company for the first decade both by their own labels in the early years but also in terms of the way they themselves are coat so i think people just some underestimate the power of the math here and don't focus on bias and entrepreneurs often have going for speed and the desire to move fast and partly this is sort of come out of startup culture because of the sort of emergencies of network affect businesses where speed often really does matter but 99 of startups don't have strong network effects 80 of them at all maybe 19 only have weak network effects and in those quality matters far more and so going slower spending an enormous amount of time picking exceptional people that are deeply synergetics exceptional in and of themselves and then have deep and meaningful synergies with the other team members creates this thing which is a sort of algebraic functional labor output and i almost think that's how you have to think in the first year how do i find amazing stand on people that are also synergetic and so my net labor output of the firm is super high and the biggest mistake i see is when their panic to hire someone 'cause they need sort of a job done and so they just go for the earliest person and then sold monarchy at the pernicious mistake is the change in higher rate based on the amount of capital available to the startup so what you notice if you go after his hiring is not consistent of 14 by quarter basis it bulges after each capital raise for the seed seed AB and then it's attenuated almost nothing in the six months before the next capital raise so there's sort of entrepreneurs like the proverbial sailor coming into port two spends all their money and then doesn't have any months afterwards but it's in hiring and if you think about that that's absolutely insane because what's the chance that you can find saviour high 10 people what's the chance you can find 8 in the first 90 days that it's right found in the first 90 days and then only right to find 2 in the next 540 days your chance coming across the exceptional people is so much lower than if you spaced out evenly and because you'll know the existing people and see them working together if you hire two in that first quarter each next one new hire you will understand their synergies with the existing team so much more what have you seen successful founders do to make sure that when recruiting they're able to win the best candidates out there so it's one thing to be patient and spend the time to identify them you also have to hold out an attractive proposition to those very talented people who presumably have other opportunities as well so what have you learned about the best recruiters in terms of how they market the opportunity and market the firm i'll give a sort of face cynical answer and then a some more aspiration answer the cynical one is just being a labor market so the low competition you really don't want to be sitting there in san francisco trying to close your candidate when john carlson's trying to close the candidate as the alternative 'cause johns gonna win knowing john i agree he's one of the greatest sex of his age but you see this actually happened well as if you're hiring that person in kiev and the other option is working and outsourced IT for deutsche bank it's much much easier win so in some ways what he wanted find is where are the incredibly qualified people in weekly competitive labor markets and that is a much easier filter than actually being good at the coating and a much more powerful one you much better being a heavyweight boxer is not very good fighting lightweight boxes then you are getting good as a heavyweight boxer and it's the same you're better going and competing in a market whether the other recruiters are lightweight because they're boring industrial firms with tenure based promotions so that's one and then two look it's some combination of sort of painting a vision that people want to be part of understanding what they themselves are motivated so it goes back to those sort of early questions are motivated by working with great people are they motivated by utilitarian impact and then more motivated by things like money and power it goes back to just getting the impression that they want to spend time with you do they actually want to spend every day with you as a founder 'cause these companies are small it's not like you're quoted by big company and the high on VP you maybe we spend an hour month with you're going to spend a lot of time with the founder so there has to be a natural desire to do this and then third i think there's just a sort of sense of being in a sort of gang that's going to succeed a sense of we happy few quote some shakespeare of just i want to be with this because this is going to be something that changes the world and it's going to be an adventure and fun and that cliche the journey will be the reward will be true and the economic outcome will be able board and when i look back to impact will have award and if you get that trip tech you'll close them i would love your take on the sort of interesting tension between what i'll call in the US sort of east coast versus west coast investing where i would say east coast investing is very traditional wall street more quantitative west coast more startup ian technology more qualitative and almost cavalier about in some cases about the quantitative aspect of things i'd love you to riff on the pros and cons of these two styles and where you see the appropriate mix of them i think this is a multi part explanation for that one part i think is the absence of existing status hierarchies in the west coast meant there was less of an opportunity cost and sort of not joining goldman and you can almost do a counter history and say maybe all this story about darpa and the valley and all that is much less important than people think maybe it you just have a new country formed of 70 to 100 million people without an existing status hierarchy you would obviously go onto the new tech to the new industry the new tech industry is obviously going to be back and so it was obvious that are sort of new country which is what the west coast was being since sort of world war two when you look at just the population numbers the west coast would obviously win that one part of it i think the second part is differences in the nature of trust and zero somnus partly because financial markets are in the traditional sense 0 sum one person stock alpha is another persons negative alpha east coast investing has had this sort of sense of i need to beat the other person i need to get a deal and that has led to sort of lower trust between participants and the west coast and maybe it's sort of part of california hippie culture tradition coming in as at this very high sense of trust and if you look at sort of the convertible note if you look at the sort of letting the founder make decisions below supervision these things only emerging very high trust culture and i'm not sure you can build trillion dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture i think you don't have it you end up building something with a billion dollars and then arguing over how to sell it or how to optimize it and you don't get that sort of shouldn't say qua aspiration that you see in all the trillion market cap companies all of which are on the west coast and then i think there's some interesting little sort of cultural foibles possibly with an actual address by the east and west coast but more by the nature of investing maybe what people do as analysts between the age of 21 and 23 so if you spend your time between 21 and 23 building excel models you tend to think more about numbers and so you tend to have a much better intuition for margin economics and so where is these coast off tonight over the west and the way they look at businesses it's they collect identify businesses with shaky unit economics but faster revenue growth and good product market fit and they're like look you have product market fit but only 'cause you're giving away $100 for 90 so of course we've got good butter market bed i'll give me some counterpoint where west coast investors do very well is where you have a product we that doesn't get evinced in the numbers immediately but it's such a sort of tactile and visual experience when you use it you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers and there are two examples one is the early iphone and i was doing some investigations for microsoft at the time and it was easier to talk about competitors than talk about yourself because your left side code to say something you shouldn't so you always trying to steer the conversation to talk about apple google something and one of the things you realized is there was a bunch of investors that sort of thought apple was overvalued when it was sort of hundred 100 billion market cap because they took the time of nokia and said even if they take all nokia's market share this business can't be big because phones only sells whatever it was back then and they couldn't into it the increase in pricing power that you were going to get from turning the phone into a computer and the west coast BC community immediately intuited that and then you see the same in this sort of almost comic battle of a tesla as a stock the apple one week and says that win on the west coast the texel story isn't fully written yet but again it's this difference from the culture that look this product is so amazing it will redefine the economics for category and investors saying when you look at this in a spreadsheet it just doesn't work and i think 1 interesting thing in general in the search for alpha is where do you get intuitions that are hard to make because there's no natural person to think of it there's a public company called zyla X ER though which is a small business accountant company an it's headquartered in new zealand listed on the essex its biggest market is accounting software in the UK but the people that fundamentally understand accounting software would be people that had followed into it which is a west coast stock nasdaq listed would be more than people may be looking into it that look at HR block there maybe even going to tableau and business analytics right and so there you had a company that quietly went from 50000000 market cap 10 billion market cap and i'm not sure anyone intuited it because new zealand investors weren't used to take the australian investors came out of a sort of mining culture and the US investors tended not to occur essex listed companies and so one thing that storm is trying to be smarter than other people is very hard and doesn't work they often trying to have an insight that you get because you sitting in different information fo just seems exponentially easier everything you highlight suggests exactly what's happened in the last 10 years which is that the primary sin for public market investors is being overly quantitative that basically anything quantitative whether pure quantitative strategies or people that rely heavily on spreadsheets as you say have tended to get trounced by people that have the more qualitative fundamental insight about what will become a very big market i'm curious how you apply those concepts in your own style of investing at an earlier stage so where does obviously there's a lot of qualitative but where does the quantitative come to play we just go a little bit further on the thoughts around that which is i don't think it's very interesting is the way you model companies in excel with the DCF there's a sort of set of cultural norms like trending down the growth rate to a terminal value overtime that obviously were correct industrial era companies the sort of companies that are KKR would buy if you were sort of modeling nabisco and barbarians at the gate it's obviously like conceptual approach maybe that's just not like for network effect businesses because instead wittry how do you model in excel the concept of india 6 something becomes a standard and therefore gets sustained accelerating growth there was some sort of joke in the 80s of you'd never get fired for buying IBM well maybe in 2006 suddenly became you never got fired for buyingsalesforcecom how do you model in that as a concept suddenly kicking into revenue growth maybe what you should be doing is writing this sort of 3000 word essay on revenue growth drivers as opposed to sort of trending it down overtime as an automatic default so there's sort of certain things where i think the industrial era protocols actually just mislead you conversely i think the counterpoint to that which is the sort of two product driven mistake is when you look for network effects everywhere and you sort of assume they exist and actually you're just getting into it standard competitive market trying to turn that to start investing i think a very good rule of thumb is to think it's very hard to extract economic lengths to get revenue without solving someone's problem so go right back to sort of jeremy bentham utilitarianism why are you making people happier how much happier are you making them and what percent of that can you extract as economic surplus and what percent goes to them so an interesting honestly pick and google there's lots of charts saying people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars for search yeah google's ad revenue ARPU per person is much lower so potentially the utilitarian output of google is 10 X maybe even 20X the economic value derived from that was imagine if you looked at something like oracle you would actually find the utilitarian benefits the economics are much higher percentage of the utilitarian benefits like there's more value capture as a percentage of the total some commonweal created the total common utility but i think even when you're talking to a company that seed you can sort of start to have that conversation over how big apartment you solving how many people are you solving that for or how much money you have those institutions got to spend on your product if it's in the enterprise and then if that's the utility created that's part one how big is that and then two is what are the competitive dynamics in this marketplace so how much of that utility would you capture and how much will just be given to your customers as consumer surplus and one of the sort of interesting wonderful tragedies the economy over the last four years is there are so many companies where 110 of the economic energy passed over to consumer surplus so you just had massive increases in living standards sort of accidental wikipedia's so there's really strange examples like LCD televisions everyone switched from cathode tube to LCD in the early 2000s that's an increasing utility but no TV companies made money because the market is too competitive same with things like improvements in consumer modems routers switches you don't see 200 billion market cap lauter companies like intel but we all benefit from far faster speeds than we did 20 years ago and so what you're looking for as an investor is high utilitarian outcome and the ability to capture it are there markers of that latter piece the ability to catch it that you see again and again that interests you most extreme is obsolete network effects must have to get these in marketplaces you get men think the classics metcalf law you get some examples where total company over today you combined data from other companies to generate insights so each time you get a new customer you improve the product for all the existing customers because you get a bigger data set to work up strangely i think spotting them has less use than spotting the fallacy's if we go to data there's an amazing sort of the last gasp of the company whose unit in the economics don't work is the values in the data and 99 of the times that isn't true and the idea is that you've got unique data set that's going to be incredibly value maybe for advertisers maybe for other customers made for enterprises because of the insights would be generated but it actually turns out most datasets will get the same insight and people there was once a company i dentist responsible but they said it if you gave the last five browsing sites in some been two or their last five latitude lanja tude locations in real space or the last five google search terms although last five credit card purchases you could basically get to the same level of activity on that person's predicted behavior which means there's a sort of false milaje oven oasis which is this can be found in the data and it turns out to be large 'cause there's so many other ways to get to that answer and so half the time what they're looking for is sort of the exact opposite it's where it appears there should be value capture but there won't be i asked once a group of people what if any specific sector category of companies they would invest in if they could only choose one for the rest of their career and one person said communications because you'll always have some monopoly to pick from which is sort of a classic expression of the network effect idea i'll go for if you pick two axes one called access is boredom and the other is complexity you want highly bowling and highly complex because everything in the universe is supply and demand curve and you just get insufficient supply of entrepreneurs in the highly bowling but highly compact space and therefore you get elevated returns so if you go through the quadrants you've sort of got the whole simple side bowling and simple and complex and simple it's just too hard to get differentiation without enough complexity that's when you get commoditisation if you go for interesting and complex you get burned entrepreneurs this is problem with space tech as an area of innovation every single person involved with space is basically a blunt genius who's passionate about their work and loves it and so very very strong competitive dynamics on the other hand if you hang out in audit software accounting software you're sitting in an area that's complex but no one wants to post they do it at a dinner party and what you might call this sort of spill it rewards of the industry lower and therefore you just get less 5 entrepreneurs therefore the transfer be entrepreneurs succeeding is significantly higher do you think that two by two matrix squares with say the trillion dollar club today of amazon and apple and some of the fang stocks do you think that they generally were at their start board no i think it would more work in this sort of case of salesforce work day tableau datadog all those classic enterprise SAS names i think the truly exceptional ones are so idiot syncratic there's no way to find them because if they were predictable you would get some competition they won't exist interesting when you say it google how many failed search companies preceded them alta vista excite lycos infoseek ask jeeves imagine that someone sent you something about google when it was a small company you would say oh it's just another search engine in some ways you almost need the opposite you need a case for why it was so obvious if you can early facebook there's all these comments and but showing my space is already won this market i think the exceptions are just so exceptional you can't formulate rules for them i think it's the next year down where there's probably more reputable behavior of the 483 angel investments that you've made what percent would you say are clearly boring to whom would be the sort of counter question i think to sort of the average person probably 350 of them obviously they're not pulling to the founder an they never boring to me i find things like accounting software deeply interesting because it's an intellectual puzzle you're solving some problem and i also think the utilitarian output to the world is way under estimated these things if you were to think what was the precursor technology to manhattan sewers play heart of manhattan without sewers but they don't sound exciting right if you were to suddenly will move them human living standards would drop exponentially and so those base technologies that sort of double entry accounting in the sort of 14th century under the medici's or whoever those things really matter as sort of system wide improvements to the thing and sometimes the joy of those can be missed before we started recording you mentioned this interesting word which you don't often hear and investing which is aesthetics i'd love you to talk a bit about mr aesthetics why they matter and why they may create bias i think this is thing where if you think about the investment career most people join a place where they fit and so they join an organization that gets them so you do have this sort of birds of a feather flock together so you tend to find that you get a set of people that either like the gritty and the real and the physical tangible look at say the overlap between stock investors looking at things like mining companies and shipping companies and then you get people that like the abstract and the deathly ill and the sort of conceptual think of atlas ian stripe companies of that till then once all this tweet some joke about that investors that they were only things with names like american asbestos and it made me chuckle 'cause it seemed that there was some sort of truth for that it felt gritty and truer more wheel and more like just better to own something that's a steel mill pompton pitts burg than it is to own a tableau or some company doing this sort of weird software stuff and so the instinct read about that is does that create biases and oversights so maybe becausw VC sort of in the 2010 to 2013 2014 network effect consumer businesses were so good maybe too much capital went into those in the subsequent years i think of like shannon scooters and things like that because there wasn't enough darwinian survival of people that focused on unit economics those partners have diminished in their political power within the VC organization versus the partners the bat more on a network effect on the product then that's a chapter in dawkins sort of selfish gene on hawks and doves and evolutionary stable populations of different behavioral strategies and maybe that also replicates in investors and of course as an investment type succeeds so it attracts more capital and more disciples and therefore there's more people looking for it and therefore the alpha is more diminished we've talked a lot about the founders and characters of entrepreneurs less so about characteristics of investors that you've worked with or seen operate what are your observations there probably haven't processed 480 three of them in the same way but i'm sure you've been around them what do you think makes for the right mix success is very idiosyncratic rather like entrepreneurs it's sort of finding the fit for their style so i know one investor at siege the fantastic investor and just has an absolute essence of getting to the nub of the character of an entrepreneur just the descriptions the articulation strength the weaknesses you would have thought should spend 200 hours doing the psychological profile it's sort of like those TV shows where you have someone profile the seal killed in like 30 seconds it's almost sort of a gift but then there's another investor at the same stage who almost ignores the person after founder in is all about the structural economics of the business the market power that ability to capture value and both styles work beautifully and then i've seen a third type almost doesn't think about the underlying company what they actually watch is other investors and sort of like a pack of lions they don't try and kill the antelope they just steal the ant work once that's down and they just swoop in and win deals they saw other good investors go for so silly wildly different strategies all three i've seen work superbly and so no cookie cutter solution i'd love to hear your take on the effects that kovid now 3 four months into it are having on the world at large both from a company standpoint for societal standpoint and at what point sort of the behaviors that have changed become very set and in some way permanently change how we live i see two main effects one is this sort of tech acceleration you've got this shift in behaviors that would have happened only over the long term from demographics as a sociologist at microsoft who once said look there's a thing called the 1975 which is people born before that just never had computers at school and so will never have the same intuitive behaviors as people born after that and it's sort of a mummy of the einstein or maybe it's einstein comment of science advances one funeral at a time and so in some ways the natural movement progress is as generations of people get older video games of classic example of this it was seen as something only for kids until those kids grow older and kept on doing it i think covid has changed that because what you've had is 70 and 80 year olds get on and you zoom and use digital apps in a way that was much more kim 25 builds that's a permanent one off shift and you will see it in the numbers for all E commerce startups every E commerce startup the numbers have gone insane to the point where start wondering whether they've made a mistake because it can't be that good you can't get that faster acceleration but no it really is that fast acceleration and my guess is the emotional experience of retail will just be less appealing than it was and so even in a world of reopening my guess is you get this continued elevation of ecommerce and then once people have shifted from doing some activity like going to a bar to playing some video game competitively probably a bigger percent of that will stick and seems obvious because this is lasted long enough that you get habit formation it certainly longer than 30 days that's for moments take then there's a much more subtle impact which is you've definitely had globalization of investing one of the things that i never made any sense to me was investors that define themselves by geography so they were in berlin and invested in companies and building because the commonality in running a startup by geography seems almost de minimas where's the commonality of say fintech globally seems much more similar to each other or quantum computing startups globally seems much more similar than icon computing company and a credit card company both within a few streets of each other so always seemed more logical to me for startups to be defined by functional earlier than by geography and that's starting to happen because if you're doing szum calls with someone there's no difference whether there a mile away from you or 1000 miles away and then the same with the labor force startups are starting to do remote in a way that was inconceivable before and what it started to do is make me think very deeply about where they can find talented people maybe i'm too optimistic but i think that may just lead to a permanent shift in overall productivity upwards because you're putting together a team not defined by the accidents of geography but defined by finding the best people you can anywhere in the world and if everyone does that you just have a bigger sort of quiddity in every type of output and that leads to just a massively higher output function what are these changes and sort of demographics and the way we live now it does seem that there's likely to be some sort of city to suburban transition an one of the things i like to do is sort of i think history is really useful investing because i hit one of the mistakes you can make as a sort of temple arrogance thinking that i'm one who lives through is sort of overly unique there's a book by will durant called season christman it's sort of whole history of loan from the founding two 500 E and sort of the fourth roman christianity afterwards so he didn't think how would you invest through that did you buy or sell lumina lyla state when caesar's murdered 'cause you get a civil war you get chaos but then you get augustus and peace afterwards then when you get this whole spate of bad emperors and it looks like everything is going to fall apart maybe you would sell and then you get the space in trajan hadrian good employees and get a great 100 years like what makes you think about sort of volatility and about having to make informations with only the information available at that time and what's interesting is you do get this sort of pattern of going from power and sort of fashion being to have your base in the city of rome to being out in kapalua or out in the smaller provinces out on it with the states and that cycle seems to go exist for like 500 years of history and if you look at london i think the peak population was in the 1930s i think it's still higher than the present population or it may just a peaked so maybe there's the beginning of one of these great 40 year demographic changes where people move back to the suburbs or not this is speculation i certainly don't have as much conviction on it as i do on startup stuff what do you make on the other end of that barbell so certainly agree that the far off collaboration is probably going to permanently change i've seen it happen just personally in many examples where now you don't care where the person is zooming in from it opens up an enormous pool of talent and you seem ridiculous for not having tried to tap that earlier the other extreme would be like hyper local what i've also noticed is the middle is gone new york city for me which is 15 minutes away is way less relevant but my town is now way more relevant and the people in it do you think there's investing portunity there or i would just be curious for any thoughts you have on kind of the local community versus the distance zoom i'm sadly out of insight on it but i think you're intuitively right in predicting the outcome i think one of the things that's going to be barely interesting is i do think there's a sort of you shape curve where for companies you either have to be remote or do you have to be centralized the bit that's going to be absolutely nightmarish is if you have a hybrid mix because what that'll lead to is everyone at headquarters will have a political advantage over everyone that works remotely and so you'll end up promoting people who chose to move to headquarters rather than worked remotely so you'll end up promoting the more politically aware which is probably the most toxic criteria you could have for long term productivity of the firm as a quick aside sarah told me to ask you about crypto an farmland and i'm curious if those were meant to be topics that are grouped together in your mind or separate and of course i'm interested in your thoughts on both crypto is super interesting because it's so un analogous to anything that's come before it so one of the interesting things with investing is people get a dopamine effect from things they've made money on before and so they like to invest in similar things or at least things that their friends made money before so they think there will be a dopamine hit foot so if you look at decks and start up from 2016 you would be amazed how often the uber of or air BB of appear as sort of marketing ploys to serve almost say you're going to get the dopamine effect investing the business that is similar to these existing successes once every so often you get something that just sort of has no epistemological pliers there's just nothing like it before and i think crypto has that and then what's so interesting about crypto is it has such strong psychological golf shafts tests so the biggest variable i've seen amongst people i know of whether they believe something like a bitcoin is viable is age in a way that i don't see for any other element tech younger people find digital money more intuitive older people find it less so there may also be something subtle there about the strength of the nation state then US investors find it less intuitive than on US investors because they think of the US government say banning crypto like FDR confiscated gold and so they think of it as unlikely whereas if you're from a country like belgium it's less obvious that your government really has the capability to do something like ban crypto so all these strange variables like the size of the country you're in and the government capability affect your conception of its viability and then it's also interesting within crypto itself that you have these two major platforms bitcoin ethereum and they sort of attract different investor types so bitcoins got the sort of association almost with austrian monetary policy with some gold with preservation of value with this sort of very trust minimized sort of slightly dark slightly almost gothic view of humanity and sort of bitcoin as a sort of place greater safety wells helium is much more sort of visually about defy changing stuff much more software much more network effects much less consciousness of trust and store value and you start to see the sort of bickering between those two cultures and it's fascinating how you've got to sort of shilling points of showing points not only are they showing points at the economic level but also showing points for investor personality types that go into them what's interesting is if they continue to do that they probably diverge far enough that there's no longer in fact any competition between them because they've diverged so much culture in aspiration's there no longer direct competitors one of the things that sort of entropy is how is wealth preserved overtime and if you look at one of the best stores of value it was forestry and there's two very interesting attributes forestry one is it's so boring no one ever bothers to seize it so if you look at people that were in a country on the wrong side of the war and occupied by an invading power over the last 2000 years things like houses and artworks were confiscated things that businesses for nationalized no one ever thought about forestry it just sort of slid under the later and then the second interesting attribute of it was that the cash flow characteristics so tellable you have to wait 50 years for trees to go you got very few investors and very few corporations doing it because imagine building an excel model showing a payback in 51 years that's really sort of only two to 3 of your principle it's so appalling you never go into it and therefore it had these characteristics work a superbly well it's sort of interesting to think what are the digital equivalents of things that have some psychological appellants to them and therefore actually will have great economic capture becauses something unappealing about them what do you think the best examples of that last concept our digital equivalents of repel an asset i think certainly up till 2017 script over that it was such a strange topic the association with things like mount box and forward and things just made it slightly sketchy and then the abstractions that the lack of physical reality of it i think makes it unintuitive people you can't touch it can't feel it it's sort of numbers in the sky things like that just don't have psychological appeal in the absence of psychological appeal is a source of alpha what do you think the most misvalued asset in the world is today i would say it's probably entrepreneurs in markets that are non obvious and i don't mean because their end market is not obvious it's people addressing global problems but in some secondary city in romania because capital markets at that stage is not efficient enough to find them as a famous company UI path i think now worth about 10 billion that came out of a mania and some visit powder matic example of that i think if you were to say where is there a cool option it's probably something in crypto it may exist or it may not exist i think one of the questions is is everything in that space now alta vista exciting local space or is it at the google and amazon stage it's a very very hard question to answer in full sight irritatingly obvious in hindsight but it does seem there's a probability mass of something being very big there because there's something about finance where it's demarcated by nation state even though it's a pure electron good and so anything that's just pure numbers in the sky should actually be globally scalable but it isn't because of the existing finance regular environment and the existing historical paths sort of banks when they were physical institutions that makes me think this globalization of finance has the potential for multiple trillion dollar market cap companies over the next decades you mentioned romania which just makes me think of europe more broadly speaking i'd be curious your relative take an opportunity in europe for business and investing when the last decade has been relatively underwhelming certainly relative to the performance of US companies it is amazing that if you look at the top 10 maybe in the top 20 by now companies in the world by market cap there exclusively US and china there's an absolutely fascinating staten says so much about the last 30 years there's a very sort of dark kind of thought which says one of the best things about europe is that you probably have a less geopolitical risk than any other place there's something about the horrors of salman vadon and stalingrad that makes it some unimaginable for germany and france to have a conflict well as i think it is much more imaginable to have china india US those some countries have conflict so in some ways one of the things you have in europe is a sort of absence of systemic risk of wipeout 'cause if you look at what we really destroys investing returns its geopolitical conflict if you look at the collapse of european wealth in world war one world war two it's just absolutely epic and i think that maybe an underpriced benefit of europe i think the other much more cheerful practical one is their countries institutions weren't developed enough to build a google arguably that's every other country apart from the US but i think it is certainly true of very small european countries because they just don't have the complexity of legal system they don't obviously means becoming public they don't have the institutional norms or the depth of financing or anything like that but now i see so many companies come out of europe the delaware corporations LLC's that have say west coast you investors the legal documents by wilson cencini or some other US firm and you have this amazing mix of sort of soviet quality education which is very high in math and logic post soviet GDP per head which basically means your capital goes very far when honda labor force but with US high trust institutions acting to sort of scale it as a corporation and that unique coming together feel special it's a fascinating take on everything i mean i had never considered really any of those angles again appealing to the 483 companies that you've invested in i'd love to know the geographic dispersion of those things generally speaking almost an even mix between USUK continental europe would account for 90 with domain 10 scattered twin asia africa latin america with a particular hub in singapore 'cause when incubator called entrepreneurs first that i invest with a great deal you've had made on the show which was a fantastic episode i love his idea of the history of the technology of ambition it's completely maps IP which was it's very interesting to think where counted people go as a framework and so if you go back and go the other way and say what can you learn from investing when you look at history it's interesting think is an under estimated cause of the decline of some institution not all the stuff people think about when they wrote about it but just that very talented people who are young tries to go a different direction so there was a time when you're a young man and you can choose do i go and do and administration of roman province or do i join the early christian church possibly the talent started to flow towards the church and away for moments tutions and actually caused weakening that is a generalized framework of where exceptional challenges to go super interesting so one thought that occurs in our world is perhaps the sort of investment banks and consulting firms in all forms of tomorrow will be much less good than their precursors 2030 years ago because so many talented people going into entrepreneurship and that talent has to pull out of somewhere now i think again from a sort of societal viewpoint i think putting bad times people in things that can scale their products to millions of people is higher utility than putting them in affectively highend artisane profession like consulting the law where the output doesn't scale it seems to me that a lot of what you're doing with your life and career is curation of people ideas companies history i mean so many different examples in our conversation today i'd love you to riff on that idea of curation and whether or not it's going to become an increasingly important skill in a world that is exploding with information and content and data very simply is if you think back to sort of 30 years ago your basic problem is lack of information so you sort of read about capital markets investors in the 90s and they're reading sec filings so leading sell side reports they're trying to get time with management but it's a fundamental lack of information problem now you look at the massive growth of available information and i think it becomes much more filtering problem and in some ways the best way to filter is to have second stage filters before your filter which is just to find amazing people and use them as filter points so there's a sort of phase which is if you hang out with people smarter harder working an molly better than oneself you always live in a funnel of positive serendipity because affectively you're dragged upwards to the mean benchmark which is higher than oneself so that's what i try to do you just described my whole life i'm playing with this idea now of it's better to be interested than interesting and as someone that's never been particularly interesting a great way to eventually become interesting is to be purely interested all the time yes 100 and i think i tricked you could overlay amazing people in a unique configuration you get an information flow that is both a creative to view it pulls you up but is also a unique lens in the world and from unique lenses you get unique opportunities by that you just mean nonoverlapping kind of backgrounds and areas of interest in the people in your network yeah i'm one of the ones that i think is always fascinates me is just part of geographically disparate networks often you get these very sort of tight communities in some ways the valley in some ways sort of new york say the hedge fund community and sometimes the most obvious insights are just from going between one to the other and just seeing the difference in worldviews in stark relief from each other and so i sort of think about that constantly i mean one of the ones that's most powerful is just thinking farmer say imagine think about the same problem not from the US perspective but from say i finished perspective on albanian perspective and suddenly topics look very very different and there's a danger of defaulting to this because of US is sort of the world hegemon to defaulting to that mindset and that's not always the best most predicted view we've talked about a lot and as we wind down i'm curious what topic that we haven't talked about at all you are most interested in of course after we finish this i'll think of tons but i'm sort of failing to think of anything in the moment i think it is one i would pick it would be one of the things that sort of fascinating in sort of this trip tech is how much startups are temple inevitabilities so as a phase someone said to me what's the difference between a hella tic under profit in tech the hell it it gets burned to the stake you know the profit becomes famous about two years and you sometimes wonder how much timing matters was a site like pinterest always going to exist within a year that you could download a page of images on the internet in under 100 number settings was that the sort of temporal inevitability of a product like that and is it the same for most products was GPS and mobile phone did that make an uber like thing inevitable in around 2000 nine 2010 one of the great unknowns is the temple one and then i think the other sort of great unknown is how much a value is actually created for the top layers of the stack by the bottom layers that don't capture it so are we all just the beneficiaries is angel investing pure the beneficiary of the emergency WS measure 'cause i can tell story whereby angel investing just didn't exist because it was negative although i see because you had spent so much in sun microsystems servers and sort of physical equipment you just had poor R across the whole industry then a WS in azure come along and critically as a startup you don't know your own future demand curve because you don't know when you're gonna get on market fit so you either have to buy too many servers in which case west capital or too few in which case you couldn't demand was with a WS measure they've effectively taken that risk out of the equation and you can almost know that your cost base only scales with your success is the entire industry just sitting on that i kind of in an intuitive field it probably is better luck and good maybe we get an AI boom in the next couple of years maybe that would be written about as that bike do some email maybe it's actually nvidia's ampere chips and the emergence of five and seven nanometer nodes just drive improvements in throughput that drives emele up so it's nothing to do with the companies that are actually working on it it's to do with sort of the pickaxe is being turned from wood to iron making their work far more efficient and but nvidia will probably capture some value of that but probably won't capture the greater value same if you were to do i sort of history of early computing the 90s and 2000s be interesting to write it from the importance of the evolution of intel chips and modem speeds as the primary drivers as opposed to the mallet of history but both these great companies will charlie i feel like i could do this with you almost weekly basis and he sort of endlessly entertained by your prolific interest in so many different things i'll certainly remember this conversation is one that's a reminder that investing in business are complicated and if you want to spend your career in those spaces you better love it because there are so many variables in so many things happening and you have to develop your own niche in your own strategy my closing question for everybody in each of these conversations is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you oh my god there are so many there are so so many examples i think it's probably a recurrent one of often my enthusiasm has been greater than my competence and it's the people that bet on the enthusiasm more than the competence and internally grateful to them i love that again you're sometimes describing my life so i know exactly what you mean and it is a wonderful thing and major category of these answers is betting on somebody early seeing something in them and taking that risk is always a great kindness will try this has been a highlight of my early week even

former head of strategy at microsoft and a prolific investor having personally invested in nearly 500 companies through his careeer i met charlie at an event hosted in new york and you can tell within one minute of meeting him that his mind is sparkling with ideas and curiosity it's no wonder he's been among the most commonly requested guests when i asked several top investors in ceos who i should have on the show we discuss the lessons he's learned about business investing in people from such a large sample size of companies i won't reveal anymore here i highly recommend you just listen to charlie and learn let's dive in charlie i like starting these things in a unique way an one idea that you've had is to have people stack rank their vices of power money and fame i help you to begin by explaining why you're interested in this idea and what you've learned from the answers over the years so it's a two part question one is the virtues which is working with people you like working on amazing problems and having impact and then the three vices power money and fame and you can't avoid them they have to be stacked going to separately an it's really trying to get at the differences between there's no good answer but there are definite good fit answers so someone who's interested in power tends to be better at execution someone's more interested in money tends to think more about some capital efficiency i tend to avoid people interested in fame but if you are doing something in showbiz it would presumably be the number one criteria if you think about the different streams sort of impact intellectual interest working with people you really get impression of where people are going to be happy and where they're not going to be happy you also start to understand why certain organizations do so well so spacex if you think about it stacks high unhealthily it's interesting that you're working with amazing people in your huge utilitarian impact in the world whereas if you're working sent fintech you're less likely to sort of that utilitarian positive impact any especially memorable or interesting series of answers that you've gotten on the two stack ranks that come to mind a lot of people have negative utility from fame alot of people start with power and then when you push them it's actually money but they don't want to say it and that's more true outside of the us culture than it is in the us it's particularly true with europeans and so a lot of it is trying to get people to actually say what they truly believe as opposed to say what they think they should say i'm curious in what context whether it be interviewing perspective founders interviewing central hires or others you find it most interesting and useful all of the above the founder one is fascinating could you actually end up going down different lines and helping them depending on whether they answer the power and the money founders advance with power tend to need help more on managing their startup capital efficiently they tend to be the ones that spend more they tend to be the ones that over expand their often too aggressive converse with the ones that answer money tend to be very capital efficient but often slightly too cautious slightly under aggressive sometimes not willing enough to stamp their authority on the company and make it the culture that it needs to be to be successful when it comes to hiring or evaluating founders apart from this two part stack ranking are there other favorite questions or devices that you return to again and again i think what you're looking for is founder market fit i think there's a sort of mistaken concept that does protonic ideal of an entrepreneur and i think maybe there's two basic things there's energy in this sort of cognitive ability but after that you're really looking for fit so if you take the sort of prototypical consumer founder they tend to have more empathy for how people behave well as if you take the classic enterprise founder they tend to be more national because in some ways you can just go and ask your customers what features do you want and go build them and so you go down those different lines and i think there's a lot of fallacy in that sort of atomic ideal what you're actually looking for is someone who is a good fit for business i'd like to take a step back now and introduce you to the audience a little bit 1 device that i've been using with people on the podcast is to ask you to give the thumbnail 2 minutes sketch of your life and career up until this point studied politics first with economics at oxford ended up very briefly mckinsey then at microsoft and then sort of mumbled my way and becoming an investor and do a lot of angel investing so i think i've done about 500 angel investments like the actual numbers 483 and about 300 in the portfolio at the moment i believe you ran strategy at microsoft what exactly did that entail and what is most memorable about that time this so many memories working with amazing people the hostile acquisition of yahoo as an attempt was just unbelievably into actually fascinating trying to buy a company in 12 stack position for i think it's 47 billion dollars and just the drama and the soap opera and realizing how much path dependency matters and big deals how much are casual comment misinterpreted by one side or the other actually changes the outcome it's remarkable how little system theory there is in the sense of if you an experiment so again and again i think you would get a lot of different results in m and a activity wells and things like product usage good products and bad product would probably be the same in each experiment 483 investments is a crazy amount i want to come back to your time at microsoft probably later on and talk in more depth about strategy but given the sheer volume of investments that you made i think a great place to begin our conversation is your idea or your thinking around why startups succeed and fail i'd love to begin by you outlining sort of what if anything is shared in common across those 483 so are there certain features that you're always looking for and sort of how your process works and then we'll get into the success and failure of startups in some ways to tie together so i think the dominant sort of failure mode for startups is the same at each different stage so that sort of pre seed to seed you basically have a failure to achieve labor productivity which is really just a polite way of saying the team doesn't come together doesn't gel and produce good output usually a team that just produces good work or generate enough sort of kinetic energy to get continuing funding once you sort of going from seed to series a it's another single cause which is how to get product market fit you're basically on the search for demand curve and you either find 1 where you don't find one and this is where you've got the highest element of pure chance in the startup it's always feels akin to sort of gold prospecting in the california gold rush which is you can be good or you can be bad you can do the right thing you can do the wrong thing but there's some elusive amanda chance the why is this perspector with the best maps and the most intelligent strategy sometimes just won't find it and someone will just fall asleep put the pan in the stream some golden come out and there really is a little nexos of serendipity at this stage then when you move to series a it's really all about labor productivity but in a different form it's can the manager scale and one of the fallacy's is most early stage startup founders think their managers and they're actually not what they have is a team that's actually managing them 'cause when you're managing say 10 or less people and you're spending time with them everyday what's actually happening is there managing you buy influence because they know you well enough and they talked to enough to work out what your desires are so as long as you're articulate and energetic and sort of engaged you actually don't have to manage the team managers you up but when you scale to 30 people to 90 people above you no longer have those personal connections and you have to move to formal management techniques and that's i can sort of fermi paradox great filter it wipes out an amazing amount of startups and the way that's divins tis a collapse in the labor productivity per person there's a term in microeconomics good managerial dis economies of scale and i think in some ways the angle of the decline of productivity per person is the difference between sort of the stripes the great startups and the failures and maybe if you're great start up as you go from 10 people to 100 people output per person drops 15 and if you're a bad start up it actually drops over 90 with the result that often 100 people startups produce arrest and they did when they had 10 people because the managerial collapse has been so extreme and wonder somethings if you get this comedy skit by big maybe there's a sort of interesting explanation where more than the shared attributes was an instinct for the sort of structures and processes and management that were shared between gates sucker burg basals the color things all these sort of super counter people because my guess is they didn't receive form instruction on it there be season advisors want that help form it it may be either by chance or by skill they just intuitive their way through it then when you get beyond that sort of series b and beyond i think it's institution building interesting problems is sort of people that become entrepreneurs are often full of energy and sort of flexibility or mr sort of combination of street smart and book smart but there's a point where they've hit product market fit were actually what they're doing is repeating a process at scale and tucupita process at scale you need to build an institution and often that sort of is almost an automatic to their personality if you're going to take in revenue from 40 two countries you really need a well developed finance department once you get to a certain size you will always be in court cases because of being sued by ex employees you have patent infringement suits you'll be debt collecting customers didn't pay like the shift to sort of building an institution with institutional norms institutional values for institutional culture and all the boring stuff of buildings from finance department strong legal department from hr department that again is a big filter and so those are sort of filters by stages what symptoms some of those you can do when you submit some precede wondering if this would close my eyes and they can't imagine this person on a public company conference call remembering the let's put in the microsoft as a microsoft learning schools and i'm thinking can i imagine them sitting as a sort of seo next cfo talking with all the sort of most reactive analysts and the buy side and the phone and just be incredible enough and deep enough mature enough to pull that off it's a fascinating set of framing the one that jumps out as maybe most interesting to me is this idea of the declining curve of peoples productivity and in your experience whether or not that is something that is typically in eight to the founder meaning they just handle that naturally and with the plum or if instead it's something perhaps that could be coached and if it's really just a set of best practices that are fairly universal that founders just don't get i think the irony is it is absolutely something that can and should be coached but often isn't so often the people that get it intuitively other people that survive but there's no need for that it can just be coached in and i think a lot of it is you get this very strong transition when your voice will start up most of the people you're employing just come in and do their job and go home and the drawback of that is you tend to end up having to do type management alot of micro management and the beauty of it is you tend to get available level politics within the organization then you get this transition to wear your hiring people that are sort of execs would be the sort of headhunters description vps senior people and the beauty of this more senior people is you can give them much more complex tasks build me a product division of doing this go open european markets for me and the drawback is it anyone capable of those complex conceptual abstractions necessary to do that tends also to be capable of politics and because the world is not composed of saints as an organization scales the level of internecine politics increases exponentially someone sent me the difference between a great company is 1 where the exact spent only 25 of the time playing politics and a bad one is wet to spend 50 of the time punk politics and that delta is entire gaussian bell curve from the best fortune 500 company to the worst and i think one of the things that really matters the founder is acting as a dampner on politics so would you sing into nice in warfare reducing the tendency for marketing to try and take control of the sales funnel would you sing tendency for the head of sales to want to take over sort of inbound marketing just trying to stop the cfo controlling spending so tightly that you don't get positive return capital investments by sales transtop sales getting so much control over spending that your margins gotta control all those boundary conditions between sort of vp he doesn't functional heads defining those well and managing through that transition is just so important and there's nowhere where someone who learns that through the process of entrepreneurship one of the things that i think belgium at peoples careers in general is the early stages that and the personalities going to them often have negative correlation with the later stages so if you could have sort of mckinsey or goldman sachs analyst often what they need is attention to detail strong work ethic high diligence high conscientiousness instead of by factors all those sort of things if you look at middle management at those companies they need good project management good ability to abstract and structure problems good ability to pull a team together and create team lol and the sort of being crossed the detail in the technical knowledge matters less and then if you look at the partner level and those firms often all that matters is relationship building and sales and charm and the ability to empathize with the client and connect with them and so it's very hard to find people that are stars in all three parts of those careers and i think it's the same with entrepreneurship the street smart entrepreneur at sort of precede who can raise money with a good narrative and get energy and recruit people and sort of create a sort of sense of momentum and a speeder core is often they negatively correlated with the sort of personality that wants to put in quarterly hr reviews and qb are reporting and really make sure that the finance team is taking at a later stage and then conversely are often the entrepreneurs do very well later finally early stage capital raising hell on earth because in some ways they're so tightly gripped to reality in the slightly pessimistic to make some very good at sort of avoiding chaos often make some very bad at pitching i would love to hear your thoughts on this interesting concept that actually our mutual friend graham and i have batted around quite a lot which is this notion that term we use based on a blog post by getting rick burton is the idea of an alien founder an alien here is used as the best possible compliment to a founder where it's somebody that just has sort of what seems to be in like an unfair and privileged access to some sort of underlying substrate the thing that is going to build the business and they just kind of know what to do they have an incredible first principles mindset typically and say bill gates would be a great example of this i think bezos would be a great example of this to use obvious ones think of that idea that in some ways the absolute best founders are in some sense alien and distinctly unique people i will maybe for the socratic psych that sort of take the opposite argument and say i think one of the mistakes that win two is just sort of seeing some ever vasant genius because you're seeing people at the height of their powers you're not seeing them on the way up there's that famous clip of bezos i think in 99 with amazon sprayed in spray paint on the back of the office it would be really interesting if you talk to him whether he is similar to the base awesome today because in the intervening 20 years remember you've got this incredible training program for the mind the working every hour in the start up there talking with the smartest people there constantly getting new information there hiring their filing step pattern recognition of executives get so much better they've got a million failed initiatives so they have all these learnings of what not to do they've got all the things that have worked and they've seen what scale they've seen the commonality and so how much of that is sort of looking in an athlete at the peak of their performance and not seeing the 10000 hours of practice that got them there and i could almost argue you could invert it and say what are actually the causes of mortality and how do we just avoid suffering that mortality this year and if you survived long enough maybe greatness eventually becomes you so one of the things i think that sort of is perhaps under estimated is if you want to live forever maybe don't start thinking about studies centenarians instead workout how to not die of a dui drunk driving or anybody else smoking 20 cigarettes a day and to some extent that same in entrepreneurship is it would be amazing and of course the problem with the observation of the world is people spend a lot of time studying greatness they don't study failure they study mohammed ali then study all the heavyweight boxes at faked out after losing their first match but maybe if you study all of those you can find a commonality in their mistake maybe they will i don't know off of their chin to the opponent or something an in startups i think there are common mistakes there's unoriginal sin about capitalizing i see so many startups three to five years in still haunted by a kebab capital raise at the beginning some investors they don't want some valuation that was hopelessly dilutive and puts bcs off now often one of the things that i see call it barely well with success is how quickly they exit their first employee that doesn't fit an i think that's actually showing is are they willing enough to be disagreeable to make the company what they want and so the willingness to cross that chasm and often you're dealing with a young founders that's a major inflection point and if you don't do it that often leads to a toxic culture and bad results then there's sort of more subtle melodies like some turning things into an academic project particularly with founders with a strong academic backgrounds often deep tech and phd's list of generals fighting the last where they think of prestige as the currency because it is in academia and so they just think if we do amazing work and we tell the world about that amazing work good things will happen because as a holistic that did work but it means they don't engage with the revenue they don't get quite product market fit its too much or sort of ivory tower intellectual exercise or conversely do they just sort of think we get momentum we get revenue we get traction it'll work and they haven't really thought about the deep microeconomics and unit economics of a scaling company and so i almost converted and say don't study greatness study failure and workout had not to be that if you're sort of thinking of history trying to be some good aluminum poles augustus will be really really difficult not being as incompetent as caligula seems really easy and so as a practical advice not making the catastrophic mistakes and just surviving long enough feels like a good strategy there were some general somewhere that said it's not that good soldiers become veterans it's that lucky soldiers become veterans but veterans are good soldiers meaning just the luck of surviving the first few hours put you up an experience curve an icy entrepreneurs transform in those first thirty six months of leadership and management and half of it is just stay alive till you get good we've talked a little bit about recruiting someone that all of a sudden seems like half my time is spent just recruiting people in all different directions curious how early you encourage entrepreneurs to make that a major part of what they do and whether or not that effectively lasts the rest of their career if they're successful so i think the clintons window estimated precisely because in an early company people replicate themselves so because people tend to hire not so much in their own image but with their own set of biases or the initial people you hire or influence with their other hires and so you can either get this sort of upwards iterating culture of excellence or you can get this downwards iterating culture of excellence so those first few hires are utterly critical and i think people way underestimate just the sort of the math of the return which is it seems excessive to say spend 100 hours hiring a person but if you're only high on 10 people that person is 10 of the output of your company for the next seven years if they stay but then if they hire as well they may actually contribute to 10 of the productivity of the company for the first decade both by their own labels in the early years but also in terms of the way they themselves are coat so i think people just some underestimate the power of the math here and don't focus on bias and entrepreneurs often have going for speed and the desire to move fast and partly this is sort of come out of startup culture because of the sort of emergencies of network affect businesses where speed often really does matter but 99 of startups don't have strong network effects 80 of them at all maybe 19 only have weak network effects and in those quality matters far more and so going slower spending an enormous amount of time picking exceptional people that are deeply synergetics exceptional in and of themselves and then have deep and meaningful synergies with the other team members creates this thing which is a sort of algebraic functional labor output and i almost think that's how you have to think in the first year how do i find amazing stand on people that are also synergetic and so my net labor output of the firm is super high and the biggest mistake i see is when their panic to hire someone 'cause they need sort of a job done and so they just go for the earliest person and then sold monarchy at the pernicious mistake is the change in higher rate based on the amount of capital available to the startup so what you notice if you go after his hiring is not consistent of 14 by quarter basis it bulges after each capital raise for the seed seed ab and then it's attenuated almost nothing in the six months before the next capital raise so there's sort of entrepreneurs like the proverbial sailor coming into port two spends all their money and then doesn't have any months afterwards but it's in hiring and if you think about that that's absolutely insane because what's the chance that you can find saviour high 10 people what's the chance you can find 8 in the first 90 days that it's right found in the first 90 days and then only right to find 2 in the next 540 days your chance coming across the exceptional people is so much lower than if you spaced out evenly and because you'll know the existing people and see them working together if you hire two in that first quarter each next one new hire you will understand their synergies with the existing team so much more what have you seen successful founders do to make sure that when recruiting they're able to win the best candidates out there so it's one thing to be patient and spend the time to identify them you also have to hold out an attractive proposition to those very talented people who presumably have other opportunities as well so what have you learned about the best recruiters in terms of how they market the opportunity and market the firm i'll give a sort of face cynical answer and then a some more aspiration answer the cynical one is just being a labor market so the low competition you really don't want to be sitting there in san francisco trying to close your candidate when john carlson's trying to close the candidate as the alternative 'cause johns gonna win knowing john i agree he's one of the greatest sex of his age but you see this actually happened well as if you're hiring that person in kiev and the other option is working and outsourced it for deutsche bank it's much much easier win so in some ways what he wanted find is where are the incredibly qualified people in weekly competitive labor markets and that is a much easier filter than actually being good at the coating and a much more powerful one you much better being a heavyweight boxer is not very good fighting lightweight boxes then you are getting good as a heavyweight boxer and it's the same you're better going and competing in a market whether the other recruiters are lightweight because they're boring industrial firms with tenure based promotions so that's one and then two look it's some combination of sort of painting a vision that people want to be part of understanding what they themselves are motivated so it goes back to those sort of early questions are motivated by working with great people are they motivated by utilitarian impact and then more motivated by things like money and power it goes back to just getting the impression that they want to spend time with you do they actually want to spend every day with you as a founder 'cause these companies are small it's not like you're quoted by big company and the high on vp you maybe we spend an hour month with you're going to spend a lot of time with the founder so there has to be a natural desire to do this and then third i think there's just a sort of sense of being in a sort of gang that's going to succeed a sense of we happy few quote some shakespeare of just i want to be with this because this is going to be something that changes the world and it's going to be an adventure and fun and that cliche the journey will be the reward will be true and the economic outcome will be able board and when i look back to impact will have award and if you get that trip tech you'll close them i would love your take on the sort of interesting tension between what i'll call in the us sort of east coast versus west coast investing where i would say east coast investing is very traditional wall street more quantitative west coast more startup ian technology more qualitative and almost cavalier about in some cases about the quantitative aspect of things i'd love you to riff on the pros and cons of these two styles and where you see the appropriate mix of them i think this is a multi part explanation for that one part i think is the absence of existing status hierarchies in the west coast meant there was less of an opportunity cost and sort of not joining goldman and you can almost do a counter history and say maybe all this story about darpa and the valley and all that is much less important than people think maybe it you just have a new country formed of 70 to 100 million people without an existing status hierarchy you would obviously go onto the new tech to the new industry the new tech industry is obviously going to be back and so it was obvious that are sort of new country which is what the west coast was being since sort of world war two when you look at just the population numbers the west coast would obviously win that one part of it i think the second part is differences in the nature of trust and zero somnus partly because financial markets are in the traditional sense 0 sum one person stock alpha is another persons negative alpha east coast investing has had this sort of sense of i need to beat the other person i need to get a deal and that has led to sort of lower trust between participants and the west coast and maybe it's sort of part of california hippie culture tradition coming in as at this very high sense of trust and if you look at sort of the convertible note if you look at the sort of letting the founder make decisions below supervision these things only emerging very high trust culture and i'm not sure you can build trillion dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture i think you don't have it you end up building something with a billion dollars and then arguing over how to sell it or how to optimize it and you don't get that sort of shouldn't say qua aspiration that you see in all the trillion market cap companies all of which are on the west coast and then i think there's some interesting little sort of cultural foibles possibly with an actual address by the east and west coast but more by the nature of investing maybe what people do as analysts between the age of 21 and 23 so if you spend your time between 21 and 23 building excel models you tend to think more about numbers and so you tend to have a much better intuition for margin economics and so where is these coast off tonight over the west and the way they look at businesses it's they collect identify businesses with shaky unit economics but faster revenue growth and good product market fit and they're like look you have product market fit but only 'cause you're giving away $100 for 90 so of course we've got good butter market bed i'll give me some counterpoint where west coast investors do very well is where you have a product we that doesn't get evinced in the numbers immediately but it's such a sort of tactile and visual experience when you use it you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers and there are two examples one is the early iphone and i was doing some investigations for microsoft at the time and it was easier to talk about competitors than talk about yourself because your left side code to say something you shouldn't so you always trying to steer the conversation to talk about apple google something and one of the things you realized is there was a bunch of investors that sort of thought apple was overvalued when it was sort of hundred 100 billion market cap because they took the time of nokia and said even if they take all nokia's market share this business can't be big because phones only sells whatever it was back then and they couldn't into it the increase in pricing power that you were going to get from turning the phone into a computer and the west coast bc community immediately intuited that and then you see the same in this sort of almost comic battle of a tesla as a stock the apple one week and says that win on the west coast the texel story isn't fully written yet but again it's this difference from the culture that look this product is so amazing it will redefine the economics for category and investors saying when you look at this in a spreadsheet it just doesn't work and i think 1 interesting thing in general in the search for alpha is where do you get intuitions that are hard to make because there's no natural person to think of it there's a public company called zyla x er though which is a small business accountant company an it's headquartered in new zealand listed on the essex its biggest market is accounting software in the uk but the people that fundamentally understand accounting software would be people that had followed into it which is a west coast stock nasdaq listed would be more than people may be looking into it that look at hr block there maybe even going to tableau and business analytics right and so there you had a company that quietly went from 50000000 market cap 10 billion market cap and i'm not sure anyone intuited it because new zealand investors weren't used to take the australian investors came out of a sort of mining culture and the us investors tended not to occur essex listed companies and so one thing that storm is trying to be smarter than other people is very hard and doesn't work they often trying to have an insight that you get because you sitting in different information fo just seems exponentially easier everything you highlight suggests exactly what's happened in the last 10 years which is that the primary sin for public market investors is being overly quantitative that basically anything quantitative whether pure quantitative strategies or people that rely heavily on spreadsheets as you say have tended to get trounced by people that have the more qualitative fundamental insight about what will become a very big market i'm curious how you apply those concepts in your own style of investing at an earlier stage so where does obviously there's a lot of qualitative but where does the quantitative come to play we just go a little bit further on the thoughts around that which is i don't think it's very interesting is the way you model companies in excel with the dcf there's a sort of set of cultural norms like trending down the growth rate to a terminal value overtime that obviously were correct industrial era companies the sort of companies that are kkr would buy if you were sort of modeling nabisco and barbarians at the gate it's obviously like conceptual approach maybe that's just not like for network effect businesses because instead wittry how do you model in excel the concept of india 6 something becomes a standard and therefore gets sustained accelerating growth there was some sort of joke in the 80s of you'd never get fired for buying ibm well maybe in 2006 suddenly became you never got fired for buyingsalesforcecom how do you model in that as a concept suddenly kicking into revenue growth maybe what you should be doing is writing this sort of 3000 word essay on revenue growth drivers as opposed to sort of trending it down overtime as an automatic default so there's sort of certain things where i think the industrial era protocols actually just mislead you conversely i think the counterpoint to that which is the sort of two product driven mistake is when you look for network effects everywhere and you sort of assume they exist and actually you're just getting into it standard competitive market trying to turn that to start investing i think a very good rule of thumb is to think it's very hard to extract economic lengths to get revenue without solving someone's problem so go right back to sort of jeremy bentham utilitarianism why are you making people happier how much happier are you making them and what percent of that can you extract as economic surplus and what percent goes to them so an interesting honestly pick and google there's lots of charts saying people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars for search yeah google's ad revenue arpu per person is much lower so potentially the utilitarian output of google is 10 x maybe even 20x the economic value derived from that was imagine if you looked at something like oracle you would actually find the utilitarian benefits the economics are much higher percentage of the utilitarian benefits like there's more value capture as a percentage of the total some commonweal created the total common utility but i think even when you're talking to a company that seed you can sort of start to have that conversation over how big apartment you solving how many people are you solving that for or how much money you have those institutions got to spend on your product if it's in the enterprise and then if that's the utility created that's part one how big is that and then two is what are the competitive dynamics in this marketplace so how much of that utility would you capture and how much will just be given to your customers as consumer surplus and one of the sort of interesting wonderful tragedies the economy over the last four years is there are so many companies where 110 of the economic energy passed over to consumer surplus so you just had massive increases in living standards sort of accidental wikipedia's so there's really strange examples like lcd televisions everyone switched from cathode tube to lcd in the early 2000s that's an increasing utility but no tv companies made money because the market is too competitive same with things like improvements in consumer modems routers switches you don't see 200 billion market cap lauter companies like intel but we all benefit from far faster speeds than we did 20 years ago and so what you're looking for as an investor is high utilitarian outcome and the ability to capture it are there markers of that latter piece the ability to catch it that you see again and again that interests you most extreme is obsolete network effects must have to get these in marketplaces you get men think the classics metcalf law you get some examples where total company over today you combined data from other companies to generate insights so each time you get a new customer you improve the product for all the existing customers because you get a bigger data set to work up strangely i think spotting them has less use than spotting the fallacy's if we go to data there's an amazing sort of the last gasp of the company whose unit in the economics don't work is the values in the data and 99 of the times that isn't true and the idea is that you've got unique data set that's going to be incredibly value maybe for advertisers maybe for other customers made for enterprises because of the insights would be generated but it actually turns out most datasets will get the same insight and people there was once a company i dentist responsible but they said it if you gave the last five browsing sites in some been two or their last five latitude lanja tude locations in real space or the last five google search terms although last five credit card purchases you could basically get to the same level of activity on that person's predicted behavior which means there's a sort of false milaje oven oasis which is this can be found in the data and it turns out to be large 'cause there's so many other ways to get to that answer and so half the time what they're looking for is sort of the exact opposite it's where it appears there should be value capture but there won't be i asked once a group of people what if any specific sector category of companies they would invest in if they could only choose one for the rest of their career and one person said communications because you'll always have some monopoly to pick from which is sort of a classic expression of the network effect idea i'll go for if you pick two axes one called access is boredom and the other is complexity you want highly bowling and highly complex because everything in the universe is supply and demand curve and you just get insufficient supply of entrepreneurs in the highly bowling but highly compact space and therefore you get elevated returns so if you go through the quadrants you've sort of got the whole simple side bowling and simple and complex and simple it's just too hard to get differentiation without enough complexity that's when you get commoditisation if you go for interesting and complex you get burned entrepreneurs this is problem with space tech as an area of innovation every single person involved with space is basically a blunt genius who's passionate about their work and loves it and so very very strong competitive dynamics on the other hand if you hang out in audit software accounting software you're sitting in an area that's complex but no one wants to post they do it at a dinner party and what you might call this sort of spill it rewards of the industry lower and therefore you just get less 5 entrepreneurs therefore the transfer be entrepreneurs succeeding is significantly higher do you think that two by two matrix squares with say the trillion dollar club today of amazon and apple and some of the fang stocks do you think that they generally were at their start board no i think it would more work in this sort of case of salesforce work day tableau datadog all those classic enterprise sas names i think the truly exceptional ones are so idiot syncratic there's no way to find them because if they were predictable you would get some competition they won't exist interesting when you say it google how many failed search companies preceded them alta vista excite lycos infoseek ask jeeves imagine that someone sent you something about google when it was a small company you would say oh it's just another search engine in some ways you almost need the opposite you need a case for why it was so obvious if you can early facebook there's all these comments and but showing my space is already won this market i think the exceptions are just so exceptional you can't formulate rules for them i think it's the next year down where there's probably more reputable behavior of the 483 angel investments that you've made what percent would you say are clearly boring to whom would be the sort of counter question i think to sort of the average person probably 350 of them obviously they're not pulling to the founder an they never boring to me i find things like accounting software deeply interesting because it's an intellectual puzzle you're solving some problem and i also think the utilitarian output to the world is way under estimated these things if you were to think what was the precursor technology to manhattan sewers play heart of manhattan without sewers but they don't sound exciting right if you were to suddenly will move them human living standards would drop exponentially and so those base technologies that sort of double entry accounting in the sort of 14th century under the medici's or whoever those things really matter as sort of system wide improvements to the thing and sometimes the joy of those can be missed before we started recording you mentioned this interesting word which you don't often hear and investing which is aesthetics i'd love you to talk a bit about mr aesthetics why they matter and why they may create bias i think this is thing where if you think about the investment career most people join a place where they fit and so they join an organization that gets them so you do have this sort of birds of a feather flock together so you tend to find that you get a set of people that either like the gritty and the real and the physical tangible look at say the overlap between stock investors looking at things like mining companies and shipping companies and then you get people that like the abstract and the deathly ill and the sort of conceptual think of atlas ian stripe companies of that till then once all this tweet some joke about that investors that they were only things with names like american asbestos and it made me chuckle 'cause it seemed that there was some sort of truth for that it felt gritty and truer more wheel and more like just better to own something that's a steel mill pompton pitts burg than it is to own a tableau or some company doing this sort of weird software stuff and so the instinct read about that is does that create biases and oversights so maybe becausw vc sort of in the 2010 to 2013 2014 network effect consumer businesses were so good maybe too much capital went into those in the subsequent years i think of like shannon scooters and things like that because there wasn't enough darwinian survival of people that focused on unit economics those partners have diminished in their political power within the vc organization versus the partners the bat more on a network effect on the product then that's a chapter in dawkins sort of selfish gene on hawks and doves and evolutionary stable populations of different behavioral strategies and maybe that also replicates in investors and of course as an investment type succeeds so it attracts more capital and more disciples and therefore there's more people looking for it and therefore the alpha is more diminished we've talked a lot about the founders and characters of entrepreneurs less so about characteristics of investors that you've worked with or seen operate what are your observations there probably haven't processed 480 three of them in the same way but i'm sure you've been around them what do you think makes for the right mix success is very idiosyncratic rather like entrepreneurs it's sort of finding the fit for their style so i know one investor at siege the fantastic investor and just has an absolute essence of getting to the nub of the character of an entrepreneur just the descriptions the articulation strength the weaknesses you would have thought should spend 200 hours doing the psychological profile it's sort of like those tv shows where you have someone profile the seal killed in like 30 seconds it's almost sort of a gift but then there's another investor at the same stage who almost ignores the person after founder in is all about the structural economics of the business the market power that ability to capture value and both styles work beautifully and then i've seen a third type almost doesn't think about the underlying company what they actually watch is other investors and sort of like a pack of lions they don't try and kill the antelope they just steal the ant work once that's down and they just swoop in and win deals they saw other good investors go for so silly wildly different strategies all three i've seen work superbly and so no cookie cutter solution i'd love to hear your take on the effects that kovid now 3 four months into it are having on the world at large both from a company standpoint for societal standpoint and at what point sort of the behaviors that have changed become very set and in some way permanently change how we live i see two main effects one is this sort of tech acceleration you've got this shift in behaviors that would have happened only over the long term from demographics as a sociologist at microsoft who once said look there's a thing called the 1975 which is people born before that just never had computers at school and so will never have the same intuitive behaviors as people born after that and it's sort of a mummy of the einstein or maybe it's einstein comment of science advances one funeral at a time and so in some ways the natural movement progress is as generations of people get older video games of classic example of this it was seen as something only for kids until those kids grow older and kept on doing it i think covid has changed that because what you've had is 70 and 80 year olds get on and you zoom and use digital apps in a way that was much more kim 25 builds that's a permanent one off shift and you will see it in the numbers for all e commerce startups every e commerce startup the numbers have gone insane to the point where start wondering whether they've made a mistake because it can't be that good you can't get that faster acceleration but no it really is that fast acceleration and my guess is the emotional experience of retail will just be less appealing than it was and so even in a world of reopening my guess is you get this continued elevation of ecommerce and then once people have shifted from doing some activity like going to a bar to playing some video game competitively probably a bigger percent of that will stick and seems obvious because this is lasted long enough that you get habit formation it certainly longer than 30 days that's for moments take then there's a much more subtle impact which is you've definitely had globalization of investing one of the things that i never made any sense to me was investors that define themselves by geography so they were in berlin and invested in companies and building because the commonality in running a startup by geography seems almost de minimas where's the commonality of say fintech globally seems much more similar to each other or quantum computing startups globally seems much more similar than icon computing company and a credit card company both within a few streets of each other so always seemed more logical to me for startups to be defined by functional earlier than by geography and that's starting to happen because if you're doing szum calls with someone there's no difference whether there a mile away from you or 1000 miles away and then the same with the labor force startups are starting to do remote in a way that was inconceivable before and what it started to do is make me think very deeply about where they can find talented people maybe i'm too optimistic but i think that may just lead to a permanent shift in overall productivity upwards because you're putting together a team not defined by the accidents of geography but defined by finding the best people you can anywhere in the world and if everyone does that you just have a bigger sort of quiddity in every type of output and that leads to just a massively higher output function what are these changes and sort of demographics and the way we live now it does seem that there's likely to be some sort of city to suburban transition an one of the things i like to do is sort of i think history is really useful investing because i hit one of the mistakes you can make as a sort of temple arrogance thinking that i'm one who lives through is sort of overly unique there's a book by will durant called season christman it's sort of whole history of loan from the founding two 500 e and sort of the fourth roman christianity afterwards so he didn't think how would you invest through that did you buy or sell lumina lyla state when caesar's murdered 'cause you get a civil war you get chaos but then you get augustus and peace afterwards then when you get this whole spate of bad emperors and it looks like everything is going to fall apart maybe you would sell and then you get the space in trajan hadrian good employees and get a great 100 years like what makes you think about sort of volatility and about having to make informations with only the information available at that time and what's interesting is you do get this sort of pattern of going from power and sort of fashion being to have your base in the city of rome to being out in kapalua or out in the smaller provinces out on it with the states and that cycle seems to go exist for like 500 years of history and if you look at london i think the peak population was in the 1930s i think it's still higher than the present population or it may just a peaked so maybe there's the beginning of one of these great 40 year demographic changes where people move back to the suburbs or not this is speculation i certainly don't have as much conviction on it as i do on startup stuff what do you make on the other end of that barbell so certainly agree that the far off collaboration is probably going to permanently change i've seen it happen just personally in many examples where now you don't care where the person is zooming in from it opens up an enormous pool of talent and you seem ridiculous for not having tried to tap that earlier the other extreme would be like hyper local what i've also noticed is the middle is gone new york city for me which is 15 minutes away is way less relevant but my town is now way more relevant and the people in it do you think there's investing portunity there or i would just be curious for any thoughts you have on kind of the local community versus the distance zoom i'm sadly out of insight on it but i think you're intuitively right in predicting the outcome i think one of the things that's going to be barely interesting is i do think there's a sort of you shape curve where for companies you either have to be remote or do you have to be centralized the bit that's going to be absolutely nightmarish is if you have a hybrid mix because what that'll lead to is everyone at headquarters will have a political advantage over everyone that works remotely and so you'll end up promoting people who chose to move to headquarters rather than worked remotely so you'll end up promoting the more politically aware which is probably the most toxic criteria you could have for long term productivity of the firm as a quick aside sarah told me to ask you about crypto an farmland and i'm curious if those were meant to be topics that are grouped together in your mind or separate and of course i'm interested in your thoughts on both crypto is super interesting because it's so un analogous to anything that's come before it so one of the interesting things with investing is people get a dopamine effect from things they've made money on before and so they like to invest in similar things or at least things that their friends made money before so they think there will be a dopamine hit foot so if you look at decks and start up from 2016 you would be amazed how often the uber of or air bb of appear as sort of marketing ploys to serve almost say you're going to get the dopamine effect investing the business that is similar to these existing successes once every so often you get something that just sort of has no epistemological pliers there's just nothing like it before and i think crypto has that and then what's so interesting about crypto is it has such strong psychological golf shafts tests so the biggest variable i've seen amongst people i know of whether they believe something like a bitcoin is viable is age in a way that i don't see for any other element tech younger people find digital money more intuitive older people find it less so there may also be something subtle there about the strength of the nation state then us investors find it less intuitive than on us investors because they think of the us government say banning crypto like fdr confiscated gold and so they think of it as unlikely whereas if you're from a country like belgium it's less obvious that your government really has the capability to do something like ban crypto so all these strange variables like the size of the country you're in and the government capability affect your conception of its viability and then it's also interesting within crypto itself that you have these two major platforms bitcoin ethereum and they sort of attract different investor types so bitcoins got the sort of association almost with austrian monetary policy with some gold with preservation of value with this sort of very trust minimized sort of slightly dark slightly almost gothic view of humanity and sort of bitcoin as a sort of place greater safety wells helium is much more sort of visually about defy changing stuff much more software much more network effects much less consciousness of trust and store value and you start to see the sort of bickering between those two cultures and it's fascinating how you've got to sort of shilling points of showing points not only are they showing points at the economic level but also showing points for investor personality types that go into them what's interesting is if they continue to do that they probably diverge far enough that there's no longer in fact any competition between them because they've diverged so much culture in aspiration's there no longer direct competitors one of the things that sort of entropy is how is wealth preserved overtime and if you look at one of the best stores of value it was forestry and there's two very interesting attributes forestry one is it's so boring no one ever bothers to seize it so if you look at people that were in a country on the wrong side of the war and occupied by an invading power over the last 2000 years things like houses and artworks were confiscated things that businesses for nationalized no one ever thought about forestry it just sort of slid under the later and then the second interesting attribute of it was that the cash flow characteristics so tellable you have to wait 50 years for trees to go you got very few investors and very few corporations doing it because imagine building an excel model showing a payback in 51 years that's really sort of only two to 3 of your principle it's so appalling you never go into it and therefore it had these characteristics work a superbly well it's sort of interesting to think what are the digital equivalents of things that have some psychological appellants to them and therefore actually will have great economic capture becauses something unappealing about them what do you think the best examples of that last concept our digital equivalents of repel an asset i think certainly up till 2017 script over that it was such a strange topic the association with things like mount box and forward and things just made it slightly sketchy and then the abstractions that the lack of physical reality of it i think makes it unintuitive people you can't touch it can't feel it it's sort of numbers in the sky things like that just don't have psychological appeal in the absence of psychological appeal is a source of alpha what do you think the most misvalued asset in the world is today i would say it's probably entrepreneurs in markets that are non obvious and i don't mean because their end market is not obvious it's people addressing global problems but in some secondary city in romania because capital markets at that stage is not efficient enough to find them as a famous company ui path i think now worth about 10 billion that came out of a mania and some visit powder matic example of that i think if you were to say where is there a cool option it's probably something in crypto it may exist or it may not exist i think one of the questions is is everything in that space now alta vista exciting local space or is it at the google and amazon stage it's a very very hard question to answer in full sight irritatingly obvious in hindsight but it does seem there's a probability mass of something being very big there because there's something about finance where it's demarcated by nation state even though it's a pure electron good and so anything that's just pure numbers in the sky should actually be globally scalable but it isn't because of the existing finance regular environment and the existing historical paths sort of banks when they were physical institutions that makes me think this globalization of finance has the potential for multiple trillion dollar market cap companies over the next decades you mentioned romania which just makes me think of europe more broadly speaking i'd be curious your relative take an opportunity in europe for business and investing when the last decade has been relatively underwhelming certainly relative to the performance of us companies it is amazing that if you look at the top 10 maybe in the top 20 by now companies in the world by market cap there exclusively us and china there's an absolutely fascinating staten says so much about the last 30 years there's a very sort of dark kind of thought which says one of the best things about europe is that you probably have a less geopolitical risk than any other place there's something about the horrors of salman vadon and stalingrad that makes it some unimaginable for germany and france to have a conflict well as i think it is much more imaginable to have china india us those some countries have conflict so in some ways one of the things you have in europe is a sort of absence of systemic risk of wipeout 'cause if you look at what we really destroys investing returns its geopolitical conflict if you look at the collapse of european wealth in world war one world war two it's just absolutely epic and i think that maybe an underpriced benefit of europe i think the other much more cheerful practical one is their countries institutions weren't developed enough to build a google arguably that's every other country apart from the us but i think it is certainly true of very small european countries because they just don't have the complexity of legal system they don't obviously means becoming public they don't have the institutional norms or the depth of financing or anything like that but now i see so many companies come out of europe the delaware corporations llc's that have say west coast you investors the legal documents by wilson cencini or some other us firm and you have this amazing mix of sort of soviet quality education which is very high in math and logic post soviet gdp per head which basically means your capital goes very far when honda labor force but with us high trust institutions acting to sort of scale it as a corporation and that unique coming together feel special it's a fascinating take on everything i mean i had never considered really any of those angles again appealing to the 483 companies that you've invested in i'd love to know the geographic dispersion of those things generally speaking almost an even mix between usuk continental europe would account for 90 with domain 10 scattered twin asia africa latin america with a particular hub in singapore 'cause when incubator called entrepreneurs first that i invest with a great deal you've had made on the show which was a fantastic episode i love his idea of the history of the technology of ambition it's completely maps ip which was it's very interesting to think where counted people go as a framework and so if you go back and go the other way and say what can you learn from investing when you look at history it's interesting think is an under estimated cause of the decline of some institution not all the stuff people think about when they wrote about it but just that very talented people who are young tries to go a different direction so there was a time when you're a young man and you can choose do i go and do and administration of roman province or do i join the early christian church possibly the talent started to flow towards the church and away for moments tutions and actually caused weakening that is a generalized framework of where exceptional challenges to go super interesting so one thought that occurs in our world is perhaps the sort of investment banks and consulting firms in all forms of tomorrow will be much less good than their precursors 2030 years ago because so many talented people going into entrepreneurship and that talent has to pull out of somewhere now i think again from a sort of societal viewpoint i think putting bad times people in things that can scale their products to millions of people is higher utility than putting them in affectively highend artisane profession like consulting the law where the output doesn't scale it seems to me that a lot of what you're doing with your life and career is curation of people ideas companies history i mean so many different examples in our conversation today i'd love you to riff on that idea of curation and whether or not it's going to become an increasingly important skill in a world that is exploding with information and content and data very simply is if you think back to sort of 30 years ago your basic problem is lack of information so you sort of read about capital markets investors in the 90s and they're reading sec filings so leading sell side reports they're trying to get time with management but it's a fundamental lack of information problem now you look at the massive growth of available information and i think it becomes much more filtering problem and in some ways the best way to filter is to have second stage filters before your filter which is just to find amazing people and use them as filter points so there's a sort of phase which is if you hang out with people smarter harder working an molly better than oneself you always live in a funnel of positive serendipity because affectively you're dragged upwards to the mean benchmark which is higher than oneself so that's what i try to do you just described my whole life i'm playing with this idea now of it's better to be interested than interesting and as someone that's never been particularly interesting a great way to eventually become interesting is to be purely interested all the time yes 100 and i think i tricked you could overlay amazing people in a unique configuration you get an information flow that is both a creative to view it pulls you up but is also a unique lens in the world and from unique lenses you get unique opportunities by that you just mean nonoverlapping kind of backgrounds and areas of interest in the people in your network yeah i'm one of the ones that i think is always fascinates me is just part of geographically disparate networks often you get these very sort of tight communities in some ways the valley in some ways sort of new york say the hedge fund community and sometimes the most obvious insights are just from going between one to the other and just seeing the difference in worldviews in stark relief from each other and so i sort of think about that constantly i mean one of the ones that's most powerful is just thinking farmer say imagine think about the same problem not from the us perspective but from say i finished perspective on albanian perspective and suddenly topics look very very different and there's a danger of defaulting to this because of us is sort of the world hegemon to defaulting to that mindset and that's not always the best most predicted view we've talked about a lot and as we wind down i'm curious what topic that we haven't talked about at all you are most interested in of course after we finish this i'll think of tons but i'm sort of failing to think of anything in the moment i think it is one i would pick it would be one of the things that sort of fascinating in sort of this trip tech is how much startups are temple inevitabilities so as a phase someone said to me what's the difference between a hella tic under profit in tech the hell it it gets burned to the stake you know the profit becomes famous about two years and you sometimes wonder how much timing matters was a site like pinterest always going to exist within a year that you could download a page of images on the internet in under 100 number settings was that the sort of temporal inevitability of a product like that and is it the same for most products was gps and mobile phone did that make an uber like thing inevitable in around 2000 nine 2010 one of the great unknowns is the temple one and then i think the other sort of great unknown is how much a value is actually created for the top layers of the stack by the bottom layers that don't capture it so are we all just the beneficiaries is angel investing pure the beneficiary of the emergency ws measure 'cause i can tell story whereby angel investing just didn't exist because it was negative although i see because you had spent so much in sun microsystems servers and sort of physical equipment you just had poor r across the whole industry then a ws in azure come along and critically as a startup you don't know your own future demand curve because you don't know when you're gonna get on market fit so you either have to buy too many servers in which case west capital or too few in which case you couldn't demand was with a ws measure they've effectively taken that risk out of the equation and you can almost know that your cost base only scales with your success is the entire industry just sitting on that i kind of in an intuitive field it probably is better luck and good maybe we get an ai boom in the next couple of years maybe that would be written about as that bike do some email maybe it's actually nvidia's ampere chips and the emergence of five and seven nanometer nodes just drive improvements in throughput that drives emele up so it's nothing to do with the companies that are actually working on it it's to do with sort of the pickaxe is being turned from wood to iron making their work far more efficient and but nvidia will probably capture some value of that but probably won't capture the greater value same if you were to do i sort of history of early computing the 90s and 2000s be interesting to write it from the importance of the evolution of intel chips and modem speeds as the primary drivers as opposed to the mallet of history but both these great companies will charlie i feel like i could do this with you almost weekly basis and he sort of endlessly entertained by your prolific interest in so many different things i'll certainly remember this conversation is one that's a reminder that investing in business are complicated and if you want to spend your career in those spaces you better love it because there are so many variables in so many things happening and you have to develop your own niche in your own strategy my closing question for everybody in each of these conversations is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you oh my god there are so many there are so so many examples i think it's probably a recurrent one of often my enthusiasm has been greater than my competence and it's the people that bet on the enthusiasm more than the competence and internally grateful to them i love that again you're sometimes describing my life so i know exactly what you mean and it is a wonderful thing and major category of these answers is betting on somebody early seeing something in them and taking that risk is always a great kindness will try this has been a highlight of my early week even

I guess this week is Charlie Song Hurst, the former head of strategy at Microsoft, and a prolific investor, having personally invested in nearly 500 companies through his careeer, I met Charlie at an event hosted in New York and you can tell within one minute of meeting him that his mind is sparkling with ideas and curiosity. It's no wonder he's been among the most commonly requested guests when I asked several top investors in CEOs who I should have on the show, we discuss the lessons he's learned about business investing in people from such a large sample size of companies. I won't reveal anymore here. I highly recommend you just listen to Charlie and learn. Let's dive in. Charlie, I like starting these things in a unique way. An one idea that you've had is to have people stack rank their vices of power, money and fame. I help you to begin by explaining why you're interested in this idea and what you've learned from the answers over the years. So it's a two part question. One is the virtues which is working with people you like working on amazing problems and having impact. And then the three vices, power, money and fame. And you can't avoid them. They have to be stacked, going to separately an it's really trying to get at the differences between. There's no good answer, but there are definite good fit answers, so someone who's interested in power tends to be better at execution. Someone's more interested in money tends to think more about some capital efficiency. I tend to avoid people interested in fame, but if you are doing something in showbiz, it would presumably be the number one criteria. If you think about the different streams sort of impact intellectual interest working with people, you really get impression of where people are going to be happy and where they're not going to be happy. You also start to understand why certain organizations do so well. So SpaceX, if you think about it, stacks high unhealthily. It's interesting that you're working with amazing people in your huge utilitarian impact in the world, whereas if you're working sent Fintech, you're less likely to sort of that utilitarian positive impact. Any especially memorable or interesting series of answers that you've gotten on the two stack ranks that come to mind? A lot of people have negative utility from fame. Alot of people start with power and then when you push them it's actually money. But they don't want to say it and that's more true outside of the US culture than it is in the US. It's particularly true with Europeans and so a lot of it is trying to get people to actually say what they truly believe as opposed to say. What they think they should say? I'm curious in what context whether it be interviewing perspective Founders interviewing. Central hires or others. You find it most interesting and useful. All of the above. The founder one is fascinating. Could you actually end up going down different lines and helping them depending on whether they answer the power and the money? Founders Advance with power tend to need help more on managing their startup capital efficiently. They tend to be the ones that spend more. They tend to be the ones that over expand their often too aggressive converse with the ones that answer money tend to be very capital efficient, but often slightly too cautious, slightly under aggressive, sometimes not willing enough to stamp their authority. On the company and make it the culture that it needs to be to be successful. When it comes to hiring or evaluating founders apart from this two part stack ranking, are there other favorite questions or devices that you return to again and again? I think what you're looking for is Founder Market Fit. I think there's a sort of mistaken concept that does protonic ideal of an entrepreneur and I think maybe there's two basic things. There's energy in this sort of cognitive ability, but after that you're really looking for fit. So if you take the sort of prototypical consumer. Founder, they tend to have more empathy for how people behave well, as if you take the classic enterprise founder, they tend to be more national because in some ways you can just go and ask your customers what features do you want and go build them. And so you go down those different lines. And I think there's a lot of fallacy in that sort of atomic ideal. What you're actually looking for is someone who is a good fit. For business I'd like to take a step back now and introduce you to the audience a little bit. 1 device that I've been using with people on the podcast is to ask you to give the thumbnail 2 minutes sketch of your life and career up until this point. Studied politics first with economics at Oxford. Ended up very briefly McKinsey then at Microsoft and then sort of mumbled my way and becoming an investor and do a lot of Angel investing. So I think I've done about 500 Angel investments like the actual numbers 483 and about 300 in the. Portfolio at the moment. I believe you ran strategy at Microsoft. What exactly did that entail and what is most memorable about that time? This so many memories working with amazing people. The hostile acquisition of Yahoo as an attempt was just unbelievably into actually fascinating trying to buy a company in 1/2 stack position for I think it's 47 billion dollars and just the drama and the soap opera and realizing how much path dependency matters and big deals. How much are casual comment misinterpreted by one side or the other actually changes the outcome? It's remarkable how little system theory there is in the sense of if you an experiment, so again and again. I think you would get a lot of different results in M and a activity wells and things like product usage, good products and bad product would probably be the same in each experiment. 483 investments is a crazy amount. I want to come back to your time at Microsoft, probably later on and talk in more depth about strategy. But given the sheer volume of investments that you made, I think a great place to begin our conversation is your idea or your thinking around why startups succeed and fail. I'd love to begin by you outlining sort of what, if anything, is shared in common across those 483? So are there certain features that you're always looking for and sort of how your process works, and then we'll get into the success and failure of startups. In some ways to tie together, so I think the dominant sort of failure mode for startups is the same at each different stage, so that sort of pre seed to seed. You basically have a failure to achieve labor productivity which is really just a polite way of saying the team doesn't come together, doesn't gel and produce good output. Usually a team that just produces good work or generate enough sort of kinetic energy to get continuing funding. Once you sort of going from seed to Series A, It's another single cause which is. How to get product market fit? You're basically on the search for demand curve and you either find 1 where you don't find one and this is where you've got the highest element of pure chance in the startup. It's always feels akin to sort of gold prospecting in the California Gold Rush, which is you can be good or you can be bad. You can do the right thing. You can do the wrong thing, but there's some elusive Amanda chance. The Why is this perspector with the best Maps and the most intelligent strategy sometimes just won't find it and someone will just fall asleep. Put the pan in the stream. Some Golden come out and there really is a little nexos of serendipity at this stage. Then when you move to Series A, it's really all about labor productivity, but in a different form. It's can the manager scale and one of the fallacy's is most early stage startup. Founders think their managers and they're actually not what they have is a team that's actually managing them. 'cause when you're managing, say 10 or less people and you're spending time with them everyday, what's actually happening is there managing you buy influence? Because they know you well enough and they talked to enough to work out what your desires are. So as long as you're articulate and energetic and sort of engaged, you actually don't have to manage the team managers you up. But when you scale to 30 people to 90 people above you no longer have those personal connections and you have to move to formal management techniques. And that's I can sort of Fermi paradox. Great filter. It wipes out an amazing amount of startups and the way that's divins tis a collapse in the labor productivity per person. There's a term in microeconomics, good managerial dis, economies of scale, and I think in some ways the angle of the decline of productivity per person is the difference between sort of the stripes, the great startups and the failures. And maybe if you're great, start up as you go from 10 people to 100 people output per person drops 15% and if you're a bad start up it actually drops over 90% with the result that often 100 people startups produce arrest and they did when they had 10 people because the managerial collapse has been so extreme and wonder somethings. If you get this comedy skit by big, maybe there's a sort of interesting explanation where more than the shared attributes was an instinct for the sort of structures and processes and management that were shared between gates. Sucker Burg basals the color things. All these sort of super counter people, because my guess is they didn't receive form instruction on it. There be season advisors want that help form it. It may be either by chance or by skill. They just intuitive their way through it. Then when you get beyond that sort of series B and beyond, I think it's institution building. Interesting problems is sort of people that become entrepreneurs are often full of energy and sort of flexibility or Mr sort of combination of street smart and book smart. But there's a point where they've hit product market fit were actually what they're doing is repeating a process at scale and tucupita process at scale. You need to build an institution, and often that sort of is almost an automatic to their personality. If you're going to take in revenue from 40 two countries, you really need a well developed finance Department. Once you get to a certain size, you will always be in court cases. Because of being sued by ex employees, you have patent infringement suits. You'll be debt. Collecting customers didn't pay like the shift to sort of building an institution with institutional norms, institutional values for institutional culture, and all the boring stuff of buildings from finance Department. Strong legal Department from HR Department. That again is a big filter, and so those are sort of filters by stages. What symptoms some of those you can do when you submit some precede wondering if this would close my eyes and they can't imagine this person on a public company conference call remembering the. Let's put in the Microsoft as a Microsoft learning schools and I'm thinking can I imagine them sitting as a sort of SEO next CFO talking with all the sort of most reactive analysts and the buy side and the phone and just be incredible enough and? Deep enough, mature enough to pull that off. It's a fascinating set of framing, the one that jumps out as maybe most interesting to me is this idea of the declining curve of peoples productivity. And in your experience, whether or not that is something that is typically in eight to the founder, meaning they just handle that naturally and with the plum. Or if instead, it's something perhaps that could be coached, and if it's really just a set of best practices that are fairly universal that Founders just don't get. I think the irony is it is absolutely something that can and should be coached, but often isn't so often the people that get it intuitively. Other people that survive. But there's no need for that. It can just be coached in, and I think a lot of it is. You get this very strong transition when your voice will start up. Most of the people you're employing just come in and do their job and go home. And the drawback of that is you tend to end up having to do type management. Alot of micro management and the beauty of it is you tend to get available level politics within the organization. Then you get this transition to wear your hiring people that are sort of execs would be the sort of headhunters description VPS, senior people, and the beauty of this more senior people is. You can give them much more complex tasks. Build me a product division of doing this. Go open European markets for me and the drawback is it anyone capable of those complex conceptual abstractions necessary to do that tends also to be capable of politics. And because the world is not composed of Saints as an organization scales. The level of internecine politics increases exponentially. Someone sent me the difference between a great company is 1 where the exact spent only 25% of the time. Playing politics and a bad one is wet to spend 50% of the time punk politics and that Delta is entire Gaussian Bell curve from the best Fortune 500 company to the worst. And I think one of the things that really matters. The founder is acting as a dampner on politics. So would you sing into nice in warfare, reducing the tendency for marketing to try and take control of the sales funnel? Would you sing tendency for the head of sales to want to take over sort of inbound marketing? Just trying to stop the CFO controlling spending so tightly that you don't get positive return capital investments by sales transtop sales getting so much control over spending that your margins gotta control all those boundary conditions between sort of VP. He doesn't functional heads defining those well and managing through that transition is just so important and there's nowhere where someone who learns that through the process of entrepreneurship. One of the things that I think Belgium at peoples careers in general is the early stages. That and the personalities going to them often have negative correlation with the later stages. So if you could have sort of McKinsey or Goldman Sachs analyst often what they need is attention to detail. Strong work ethic, high diligence, high conscientiousness instead of by factors. All those sort of things. If you look at middle management at those companies, they need good project management, good ability to abstract and structure problems, good ability to pull a team together and create team LOL. And the sort of being crossed the detail in the technical knowledge matters less. And then if you look at the partner level and those firms often all that matters is relationship building and sales and charm and the ability to empathize with the client and connect with them. And so it's very hard to find people that are stars in all three parts of those careers. And I think it's the same with entrepreneurship, the street smart entrepreneur at sort of precede who can raise money with a good narrative and get energy and recruit people and sort of create. A sort of sense of momentum and a speeder core is often they negatively correlated with the sort of personality that wants to put in quarterly HR reviews and QB are reporting and really make sure that the finance team is taking at a later stage and then, Conversely, are often the entrepreneurs do very well later. Finally, early stage capital raising hell on Earth because in some ways they're so tightly gripped to reality in the slightly pessimistic to make some very good at sort of avoiding chaos often make some very bad at pitching. I would love to hear your thoughts on this interesting concept that actually our mutual friend Graham and I have batted around quite a lot, which is this notion that term we use based on a blog post by getting Rick Burton is the idea of an alien founder an alien here is used as the best possible compliment to a founder where it's somebody that just has sort of what seems to be in like an unfair and privileged access to some sort of underlying substrate. The thing that is going to build the business and they just kind of know what to do. They have an incredible first principles mindset, typically and say Bill Gates would be a great example of this. I think Bezos would be a great example of this to use obvious ones. Think of that idea that in some ways the absolute best founders are in some sense alien and distinctly unique people. I will maybe for the Socratic psych, that sort of take the opposite argument and say I think one of the mistakes that win two is just sort of seeing some ever Vasant genius, because you're seeing people at the height of their powers, you're not seeing them on the way up. There's that famous clip of Bezos, I think in 99 with Amazon sprayed in spray paint on the back of the office, it would be really interesting if you talk to him whether he is similar to the base. Awesome today, because in the intervening 20 years. Remember you've got this incredible training program for the mind. The working every hour in the start up there talking with the smartest people there, constantly getting new information there, hiring their filing step pattern, recognition of executives get so much better, they've got a million failed initiatives. So they have all these learnings of what not to do. They've got all the things that have worked and they've seen what scale they've seen the commonality, and so, how much of that is sort of looking in an athlete at the peak of their performance and not seeing the 10,000 hours of practice. That got them there and I could almost argue you could invert it and say what are actually the causes of mortality and how do we just avoid suffering that mortality this year? And if you survived long enough, maybe greatness eventually becomes you. So one of the things I think that sort of is perhaps under estimated is if you want to live forever, maybe don't start thinking about studies, centenarians, instead workout, how to not die of a. DUI. Drunk driving or anybody else smoking 20 cigarettes a day and to some extent that same in entrepreneurship is. It would be amazing, and of course the problem with the observation of the world is people spend a lot of time studying greatness. They don't study failure, they study Mohammed Ali, then study all the heavyweight boxes at faked out. After losing their first match. But maybe if you study all of those, you can find a commonality in their mistake. Maybe they will. I don't know off of their chin to the opponent or something an in startups. I think there are common mistakes. There's unoriginal sin about capitalizing. I see so many startups, three to five years in still haunted by a kebab capital raise at the beginning. Some investors they don't want some valuation that was hopelessly dilutive and puts BCS off. Now often, one of the things that I see call it barely well with success is how quickly they exit their first employee. That doesn't fit an. I think that's actually showing is are they willing enough to be disagreeable? To make the company what they want? And so the willingness to cross that chasm. And often you're dealing with a young founders. That's a major inflection point, and if you don't do it, that often leads to a toxic culture and bad results. Then there's sort of more subtle melodies, like some turning things into an academic project, particularly with Founders with a strong academic backgrounds, often deep tech and PHD's list of generals fighting the last where they think of prestige as the currency, because it is in academia and so they just think if we do amazing work and we tell the world about that amazing work, good things will happen, because as a holistic that did work, but it means they don't engage with the revenue, they don't get quite product market fit, its too much or sort of ivory tower intellectual exercise. Or Conversely, do they just sort of think we get momentum? We get revenue, we get traction, it'll work, and they haven't really thought about the deep microeconomics and unit economics of a scaling company. And so I almost converted and say don't study greatness, study failure and workout had not to be that if you're sort of thinking of history trying to be some good aluminum poles, Augustus will be really, really difficult. Not being as incompetent as Caligula seems really easy. And so as a practical advice not making the. Catastrophic mistakes and just surviving long enough feels like a good strategy. There were some general somewhere that said it's not that good. Soldiers become veterans. It's that lucky soldiers become veterans, but veterans are good soldiers, meaning just the luck of surviving the first few hours put you up an experience curve, an icy entrepreneurs transform in those first thirty six months of leadership and management and half of it is just stay alive till you get good. We've talked a little bit about recruiting someone that all of a sudden seems like half my time is spent just recruiting people in all different directions. Curious how early you encourage entrepreneurs to make that a major part of what they do and whether or not that effectively lasts the rest of their career if they're successful. So I think the Clintons window estimated precisely because in an early company, people replicate themselves. So because people tend to hire not so much in their own image but with their own set of biases or the initial people you hire or influence with their other hires. And so you can either get this sort of upwards iterating culture of excellence, or you can get this downwards. Iterating culture of excellence. So those first few hires are utterly critical and I think people way underestimate just the sort of the math of the return. Which is it seems excessive to say, spend 100 hours hiring a person, but if you're only high on 10 people, that person is 10% of the output of your company for the next seven years. If they stay. But then if they hire as well, they may actually contribute to 10% of the productivity of the company for the first decade, both by their own labels in the early years, but also in terms of the way they themselves are coat. So I think people just some underestimate the power of the math here and don't focus on bias and entrepreneurs often have. Going for speed and the desire to move fast and partly this is sort of come out of startup culture because of the sort of emergencies of network affect businesses where speed often really does matter. But 99% of startups don't have strong network effects, 80% of them at all. Maybe 19% only have weak network effects, and in those quality matters far more and so going slower. Spending an enormous amount of time, picking exceptional people that are deeply synergetics exceptional in and of themselves, and then have. Deep and meaningful synergies with the other team members creates this thing, which is a sort of algebraic functional labor output, and I almost think that's how you have to think in the first year. How do I find amazing stand on people that are also synergetic and so my net labor output of the firm is super high and the biggest mistake I see is when their panic to hire someone 'cause they need sort of a job done and so they just go for the earliest person and then sold monarchy at the pernicious mistake is the. Change in higher rate based on the amount of capital available to the startup. So what you notice if you go after his hiring is not consistent of 1/4 by quarter basis, it bulges after each capital raise for the seed seed AB and then it's attenuated. Almost nothing in the six months before the next capital raise, so there's sort of entrepreneurs like the proverbial sailor coming into port Two, spends all their money and then doesn't have any months afterwards. But it's in hiring. And if you think about that, that's absolutely insane because. What's the chance that you can find Saviour High 10 people? What's the chance you can find 8 in the first 90 days that it's right found in the first 90 days and then only right to find 2 in the next 540 days. Your chance coming across the exceptional people is so much lower than if you spaced out evenly and because you'll know the existing people and see them working together. If you hire two in that first quarter, each next one new hire, you will understand their synergies with the existing team so much more. What have you seen successful founders do to make sure that when recruiting, they're able to win the best candidates out there. So it's one thing to be patient and spend the time to identify them. You also have to hold out an attractive proposition to those very talented people who presumably have other opportunities as well. So what have you learned about the best recruiters in terms of how they market the opportunity and market the firm? I'll give a sort of face cynical answer and then a some more aspiration answer. The cynical one is just being a labor market, so the low competition you really don't want to be sitting there in San Francisco trying to close your candidate. When John Carlson's trying to close the candidate as the alternative, 'cause Johns gonna win. Knowing John, I agree. He's one of the greatest sex of his age. But you see this actually happened well as if you're hiring that person in Kiev and the other option is working and outsourced IT for Deutsche Bank. It's much, much easier win. So in some ways, what he wanted find is where are the incredibly qualified people in weekly competitive labor markets and that is a much easier filter than actually being good at the coating, and a much more powerful one. You much better being a heavyweight boxer is not very good fighting lightweight boxes. Then you are getting good as a heavyweight boxer and it's the same. You're better going and competing in a market, whether the other recruiters are lightweight because they're boring industrial firms with tenure based promotions, so that's one. And then two look, it's some combination of sort of painting, a vision. That people want to be part of understanding what they themselves are motivated so it goes back to those sort of early questions are motivated by working with great people. Are they motivated by utilitarian impact and then more motivated by things like money and power? It goes back to just getting the impression that they want to spend time with you. Do they actually want to spend every day with you as a founder? 'cause these companies are small. It's not like you're quoted by big company and the high on VP. You maybe we spend an hour month with. You're going to spend a lot of time with the founder, so there has to be. A natural desire to do this, and then third, I think there's just a sort of sense of being in a sort of gang that's going to succeed. A sense of we happy. Few quote, some Shakespeare of just I want to be with this, because this is going to be something that changes the world and it's going to be an adventure and fun. And that cliche. The journey will be the reward will be true, and the economic outcome will be able board. And when I look back to impact will have award. And if you get that trip tech you'll close. Them. I would love your take on the sort of interesting tension between what I'll call in the US sort of East Coast versus West Coast investing, where I would say East Coast investing is very traditional Wall Street, more quantitative West Coast, more startup Ian Technology, more qualitative and almost cavalier about in some cases about the quantitative aspect of things. I'd love you to riff on the pros and cons of these two styles and where you see the appropriate mix of them. I think this is a multi part explanation for that one part I think is the absence of existing status hierarchies in the West Coast meant there was less of an opportunity cost and sort of not joining Goldman and you can almost do a counter history and say maybe all this story about DARPA and the Valley and all that is much less important than people think. Maybe it you just have a new country formed of 70 to 100 million people without an existing status hierarchy you would obviously go onto the new tech. To the new industry, the new tech industry is obviously going to be back, and so it was obvious that are sort of new country, which is what the West Coast was being. Since sort of World War Two. When you look at just the population numbers, the West Coast would obviously win that one part of it. I think the second part is differences in the nature of trust and zero somnus, partly because financial markets are, in the traditional sense 0 sum, one person, stock Alpha is another persons negative Alpha East Coast investing has had this sort of sense of I need to beat the other person. I need to get a deal and that has led to sort of lower trust between participants and the West Coast, and maybe it's sort of part of California hippie culture tradition coming in as at this very high sense of trust. And if you look at sort of the convertible note, if you look at the sort of letting the founder make decisions below supervision, these things only emerging very high trust culture, and I'm not sure you can build trillion dollar market cap companies without that high trust culture. I think you don't have it. You end up building something with a billion dollars and then arguing over how to sell it or how to optimize it. And you don't get that sort of. Shouldn't say qua aspiration, that you see in all the trillion market cap companies, all of which are on the West Coast. And then I think there's some interesting little sort of cultural foibles, possibly with an actual address by the East and West Coast, but more by the nature of investing. Maybe what people do as analysts between the age of 21 and 23. So if you spend your time between 21 and 23 building Excel models. You tend to think more about numbers and so you tend to have a much better intuition for margin economics and so where is these coast off tonight over the West and the way they look at businesses, it's they collect, identify businesses with shaky unit economics, but faster revenue growth and good product market fit. And they're like look you have product market fit, but only 'cause you're giving away $100 for 90. So of course we've got good butter market bed. I'll give me some counterpoint where West Coast investors do very well is where you have a product we. That doesn't get evinced in the numbers immediately, but it's such a sort of tactile and visual experience when you use it, you have to make an imaginative leap to turn that into numbers, and there are two examples. One is the early iPhone and I was doing some investigations for Microsoft at the time and it was easier to talk about competitors than talk about yourself because your left side code to say something you shouldn't, so you always trying to steer the conversation to talk about Apple, Google something and one of the things you realized is there was a bunch of investors that sort of thought Apple was overvalued when it was sort of. Hundred 100 billion market cap because they took the time of Nokia and said even if they take all Nokia's market share, this business can't be big because phones only sells whatever it was back then and they couldn't into it. The increase in pricing power that you were going to get from turning the phone into a computer and the West Coast BC community immediately intuited that and then you see the same in this sort of almost comic battle of a Tesla as a stock. the Apple One week and says that win on the West Coast, the Texel story isn't fully written yet. But again, it's this difference from the culture that. Look, this product is so amazing it will redefine the economics for category and investors saying when you look at this in a spreadsheet it just doesn't work and I think 1 interesting thing in general in the search for Alpha is where do you get intuitions that are hard to make because there's no natural person to think of it. There's a public company called Zyla X ER though, which is a small business accountant company an it's headquartered in New Zealand listed on the Essex. Its biggest market is accounting software in the UK, but the people that fundamentally understand accounting software. Would be people that had followed into it, which is a West Coast stock. NASDAQ listed would be more than people may be looking into it that look at H&R Block there. Maybe even going to Tableau and business analytics right? And so there you had a company that quietly went from 50,000,000 market cap. 10 billion market cap and I'm not sure anyone intuited it because New Zealand investors weren't used to take the Australian investors came out of a sort of mining culture and the US investors tended not to occur. Essex listed companies and so one thing that storm is trying to be smarter than other people. Is very hard and doesn't work. They often trying to have an insight that you get because you sitting in different information fo just seems exponentially easier. Everything you highlight suggests exactly what's happened in the last 10 years, which is that the primary sin for public market investors is being overly quantitative. That basically anything quantitative, whether pure quantitative strategies or people that rely heavily on spreadsheets, as you say, have tended to get trounced by people that have the more qualitative, fundamental insight about what will become a very big market. I'm curious how you apply those concepts in your own style of investing at an earlier stage, so where does? Obviously, there's a lot of qualitative, but where does the quantitative come to play? We just go a little bit further on the thoughts around that, which is I don't think it's very interesting, is the way you model companies in Excel with the DCF. There's a sort of set of cultural norms like trending down the growth rate to a terminal value overtime that obviously were correct industrial era companies. The sort of companies that are KKR would buy if you were sort of modeling Nabisco and Barbarians at the gate. It's obviously like conceptual approach. Maybe that's just not like for network effect businesses because instead wittry. How do you model in Excel? The concept of India 6 something becomes a standard and therefore gets sustained accelerating growth. There was some sort of joke in the 80s of you'd never get fired for buying IBM. Well, maybe in 2006 suddenly became you never got fired for buyingsalesforce.com. How do you model in that as a concept, suddenly kicking into revenue growth? Maybe what you should be doing is writing this sort of 3000 word essay on revenue growth drivers as opposed to sort of trending it down overtime. As an automatic default, so there's sort of certain things where I think the industrial era protocols actually just mislead you. Conversely, I think the counterpoint to that which is the sort of two product driven mistake, is when you look for network effects everywhere and you sort of assume they exist. And actually you're just getting into it. Standard competitive market. Trying to turn that to start investing. I think a very good rule of thumb is to think it's very hard to extract economic lengths to get revenue without solving someone's problem. So go right back to sort of Jeremy Bentham utilitarianism. Why are you making people happier? How much happier are you making them, and what percent of that can you extract as economic surplus? And what percent goes to them? So an interesting honestly. Pick and Google. There's lots of charts saying people would pay thousands and thousands of dollars for search. Yeah, Google's ad revenue ARPU per person is much lower. So potentially the utilitarian output of Google is 10 X maybe even 20X. The economic value derived from that was imagine if you looked at something like. Oracle, you would actually find the utilitarian benefits. The economics are much higher percentage of the utilitarian benefits, like there's more value capture as a percentage of the total. Some commonweal created, the total common utility, but I think even when you're talking to a company that seed, you can sort of start to have that conversation over how big apartment you solving. How many people are you solving that for, or how much money you have? Those institutions got to spend on your product. If it's in the enterprise, and then if that's the utility created, that's part one. How big is that? And then two is what are the competitive dynamics in this marketplace? So how much of that utility would you capture and how much will just be given to your customers as consumer surplus and one of the sort of interesting, wonderful tragedies the economy over the last four years is. There are so many companies where 110% of the economic energy passed over to consumer surplus. So you just had massive increases in living standards, sort of accidental Wikipedia's. So there's really strange examples like LCD televisions, everyone switched from cathode tube to LCD. In the early 2000s, that's an increasing utility, but no TV companies made money because the market is too competitive. Same with things like improvements in consumer modems, routers, switches, you don't see 200 billion market cap lauter companies like Intel. But we all benefit from far faster speeds than we did 20 years ago, and So what you're looking for as an investor is high utilitarian outcome and the ability to capture it. Are there markers of that latter piece? The ability to catch it that you see again and again that interests you? Most extreme is obsolete. Network effects must have to get these. In marketplaces you get men think the classics Metcalf law. You get some examples where total company over today you combined data from other companies to generate insights. So each time you get a new customer you improve the product for all the existing customers because you get a bigger data set to work up strangely. I think spotting them has less use than spotting the fallacy's. If we go to data, there's an amazing sort of the last gasp of the company whose unit in the economics don't work is. The values in the data and 99% of the times that isn't true and the idea is that you've got unique data set. That's going to be incredibly value. Maybe for advertisers, maybe for other customers made for enterprises because of the insights would be generated, but it actually turns out most datasets will get the same insight and people there was once a company I dentist responsible, but they said it. If you gave the last five browsing sites in some been two or their last five latitude lanja tude locations in real space, or. The last five Google search terms, although last five credit card purchases, you could basically get to the same level of activity on that person's predicted behavior, which means there's a sort of false milaje oven Oasis, which is. This can be found in the data, and it turns out to be large 'cause there's so many other ways to get to that answer, and so half the time what they're looking for is sort of the exact opposite. It's where it appears there should be value capture, but there won't be. I asked once a group of people what, if any, specific sector category of companies they would invest in if they could only choose one for the rest of their career and one person said communications because you'll always have some monopoly to pick from, which is sort of a classic expression of the network effect idea. I'll go for if you pick two axes, one called access is boredom and the other is complexity. You want highly bowling and highly complex because everything in the universe is supply and demand curve and you just get insufficient supply of entrepreneurs in the highly bowling but highly compact space and therefore you get elevated returns. So if you go through the quadrants you've sort of got the whole simple side bowling and simple and complex and simple. It's just too hard to get differentiation without enough complexity. That's when you get commoditisation. If you go for interesting and complex, you get burned. Entrepreneurs, this is problem with space tech as an area of innovation, every single person involved with space is basically a blunt genius who's passionate about their work and loves it and so very, very strong competitive dynamics. On the other hand, if you hang out in audit software accounting software, you're sitting in an area that's complex, but no one wants to post. They do it at a dinner party and what you might call this sort of spill it rewards of the industry lower, and therefore you just get less 5 entrepreneurs. Therefore, the transfer be entrepreneurs. Succeeding is significantly higher. Do you think that two by two matrix squares with, say the trillion dollar Club today of Amazon and Apple and some of the Fang stocks? Do you think that they generally were at their start board? No, I think it would more work in this sort of case of Salesforce Work Day, Tableau, datadog, all those classic enterprise SAS names. I think the truly exceptional ones are so idiot syncratic there's no way to find them because if they were predictable you would get some competition. They won't exist. Interesting when you say it. Google how many failed search companies preceded them. Alta Vista excite, Lycos, Infoseek ask Jeeves. Imagine that someone sent you something about Google when it was a small company you would say oh, it's just another search engine. In some ways you almost need the opposite. You need a case for why it was so obvious. If you can early Facebook. There's all these comments and but showing my space is already won this market. I think the exceptions are just so exceptional you can't formulate rules for them. I think it's the next year down where there's probably more reputable behavior. Of the 483 Angel investments that you've made, what percent would you say are clearly boring? To whom would be the sort of counter question? I think to sort of the average person, probably 350 of them. Obviously they're not pulling to the Founder an they never boring to me. I find things like accounting software deeply interesting because it's an intellectual puzzle you're solving some problem. And I also think the utilitarian output to the world is way under estimated these things. If you were to think what was the precursor technology to Manhattan? Sewers. Play Heart of Manhattan without sewers, but they don't sound exciting, right? If you were to suddenly will move them. Human living standards would drop exponentially, and so those base technologies, that sort of double entry accounting in the sort of 14th century under the Medici's or whoever those things really matter as sort of system wide improvements to the thing. And sometimes the joy of those can be missed. Before we started recording, you mentioned this interesting word, which you don't often hear, and investing which is aesthetics. I'd love you to talk a bit about. Mr Aesthetics, why they matter and why they may create bias. I think this is thing where if you think about the investment career, most people join a place where they fit and so they join an organization that gets them. So you do have this sort of birds of a feather flock together so you tend to find that you get a set of people that either like the gritty and the real and the physical tangible look at say the overlap between stock investors looking at things like mining companies and shipping companies. And then you get people that like. The abstract and the deathly ill and the sort of conceptual think of Atlas Ian Stripe companies of that. Till then, once all this tweet. Some joke about that investors that they were only things with names like American asbestos and it made me chuckle. 'cause it seemed that there was some sort of truth for that. It felt gritty and truer more wheel and more like just better to own something. That's a steel mill, Pompton Pitts Burg than it is to own a tableau or some company doing this sort of weird software stuff. And so the instinct read about that is does that create biases and oversights? So maybe Becausw VC sort of in the 2010 to 2013, 2014 Network effect. Consumer businesses were so good, maybe too much capital went into those in the subsequent years. I think of like Shannon scooters and things like that because there wasn't enough Darwinian survival of people that focused on unit economics. Those partners have diminished in their political power within the VC organization versus the partners. The bat more on a network effect on the product then that's a chapter in Dawkins sort of selfish gene on Hawks and doves and evolutionary stable populations of different behavioral strategies. And maybe that also replicates in investors. And of course as an investment type succeeds, so it attracts more capital and more disciples, and therefore there's more people looking for it, and therefore the Alpha is more diminished. We've talked a lot about the founders and characters of entrepreneurs, less so about characteristics of investors that you've worked with or seen operate. What are your observations? There? Probably haven't processed 480, three of them in the same way, but I'm sure you've been around them. What do you think makes for the right mix? Success is very idiosyncratic. Rather like entrepreneurs, it's sort of finding the fit for their style, so I know one investor at siege, the fantastic investor and just has an absolute essence of getting to the nub of the character of an entrepreneur. Just the descriptions, the articulation strength, the weaknesses you would have thought should spend 200 hours doing the psychological profile. It's sort of like those TV shows where you have someone profile the seal killed in like 30 seconds. It's almost sort of a gift. But then there's another investor at the same stage who almost ignores the person after founder in is all about the structural economics of the business, the market power, that ability to capture value, and both styles work beautifully. And then I've seen a third type almost doesn't think about the underlying company, what they actually watch is other investors and sort of like a pack of Lions. They don't try and kill the antelope, they just steal the Ant work once that's down and they just swoop in and win deals. They saw other good investors go for so silly, wildly different strategies. All three I've seen work superbly, and so no cookie cutter solution. I'd love to hear your take on the effects that Kovid Now 3, four months into it are having on the world at large, both from a company standpoint for societal standpoint and at what point sort of the behaviors that have changed become very set and in some way permanently change how we live. I see two main effects. One is this sort of tech acceleration. You've got this shift in behaviors that would have happened only over the long term from demographics as a sociologist at Microsoft who once said, look, there's a thing called the 1975, which is people born before that. Just never had computers at school, and so will never have the same intuitive behaviors as people born after that. And it's sort of a mummy of the Einstein. Or maybe it's Einstein. Comment of science advances. One funeral at a time, and so in some ways, the natural. Movement progress is as generations of people get older video games of classic example of this. It was seen as something only for kids until those kids grow older and kept on doing it. I think Covid has changed that because what you've had is 70 and 80 year olds get on and you zoom and use digital apps in a way that was much more. Kim 25 builds. That's a permanent one off shift and you will see it in the numbers for all E Commerce startups. Every E Commerce startup the numbers have gone insane to the point where. Start wondering whether they've made a mistake because it can't be that good. You can't get that faster acceleration, but no, it really is that fast. Acceleration, and my guess is the emotional experience of retail will just be less appealing than it was, and so even in a world of reopening, my guess is you get this continued elevation of ecommerce and then once people have shifted from doing some activity like going to a bar to playing some video game competitively, probably a bigger percent of that will stick and seems obvious because. This is lasted long enough that you get habit formation. It certainly longer than 30 days. That's for moments. Take then there's a much more subtle impact, which is you've definitely had globalization of investing. One of the things that I never made any sense to me was investors that define themselves by geography. So they were in Berlin and invested in companies and building because the commonality in running a startup by geography seems almost de Minimas. Where's the commonality of, say, Fintech globally? Seems much more similar to each other or quantum computing startups globally? Seems much more similar than Icon Computing Company and a credit card company, both within a few streets of each other, so always seemed more logical to me for startups to be defined by functional earlier than by geography, and that's starting to happen because if you're doing szum calls with someone, there's no difference whether there a mile away from you or 1000 miles away and then the same with the labor force. Startups are starting to do remote in a way that was inconceivable before, and what it started to do is make me think very deeply about where they can find talented people. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I think that may just lead to a permanent. Shift in overall productivity upwards because you're putting together a team not defined by the accidents of geography but defined by finding the best people you can anywhere in the world. And if everyone does that, you just have a bigger sort of quiddity in every type of output, and that leads to just a massively higher output function. What are these changes and sort of demographics and the way we live now? It does seem that there's likely to be some sort of city to suburban transition, an one of the things I like to do is sort of. I think history is really useful. Investing because I hit one of the mistakes you can make as a sort of temple arrogance. Thinking that I'm one who lives through is sort of overly unique. There's a book by Will Durant called season Christman. It's sort of whole history of loan from the founding two 500 E and sort of the fourth Roman Christianity afterwards. So he didn't think how would you invest through that? Did you buy or sell Lumina Lyla State when Caesar's murdered? 'cause you get a civil war, you get chaos, but then you get Augustus and peace afterwards, then. When you get this whole spate of bad emperors, and it looks like everything is going to fall apart, maybe you would sell and then you get the space in Trajan, Hadrian good employees and get a great 100 years like what makes you think about sort of volatility and about having to make informations with only the information available at that time. And what's interesting is you do get this sort of pattern of going from power and sort of fashion being to have your base in the city of Rome to being out in Kapalua or out in the smaller provinces. Out on it with the States and that cycle seems to go exist for like 500 years of history. And if you look at London I think the peak population was in the 1930s. I think it's still higher than the present population, or it may just a peaked. So maybe there's the beginning of one of these great 40 year demographic changes where people move back to the suburbs or not. This is speculation. I certainly don't have as much conviction on it as I do on startup stuff. What do you make on the other end of that barbell? So certainly agree that the far off collaboration is probably going to permanently change. I've seen it happen just personally in many examples, where now you don't care where the person is zooming in from, it opens up an enormous pool of talent and you seem ridiculous for not having tried to tap that earlier. The other extreme would be like hyper local. What I've also noticed is the middle is gone. New York City for Me, which is 15 minutes away, is way less relevant, but my town is now way more relevant and the people in it. Do you think there's investing? Portunity there or I would just be curious for any thoughts you have on kind of the local community versus the distance zoom. I'm sadly out of insight on. It, but I think you're intuitively right in predicting the outcome. I think one of the things that's going to be barely interesting is, I do think there's a sort of you shape curve where for companies you either have to be remote, or do you have to be centralized? The bit that's going to be absolutely nightmarish is if you have a hybrid mix, because what that'll lead to is everyone at headquarters will have a political advantage over everyone that works remotely. And so you'll end up promoting people who chose to move to headquarters rather than worked remotely, so you'll end up promoting the more politically aware, which is probably the most toxic criteria you could have for long term productivity of the firm. As a quick aside, Sarah told me to ask you about Crypto, an farmland, and I'm curious if those were meant to be topics that are grouped together in your mind or separate. And of course I'm interested in your thoughts on both. Crypto Is super interesting because it's so UN analogous to anything that's come before it, so one of the interesting things with investing is people get a dopamine effect from things they've made money on before, and so they like to invest in similar things, or at least things that their friends made money before, so they think there will be a dopamine hit foot. So if you look at decks and start up from 2016, you would be amazed how often the Uber of or air B&B of appear as sort of marketing ploys to serve. Almost say you're going to get. The dopamine effect. Investing the business that is similar to these existing successes once every so often you get something that just sort of has no epistemological pliers. There's just nothing like it before, and I think Crypto has that and then what's so interesting about crypto is it has such strong psychological golf shafts tests, so the biggest variable I've seen amongst people I know of, whether they believe something like a Bitcoin, is viable, is age in a way that I don't see for any other element tech. Younger people find digital money. More intuitive, older people find it less so. There may also be something subtle there about the strength of the nation state. Then US investors find it less intuitive than on US investors because they think of the US government say banning crypto like FDR confiscated gold, and so they think of it as unlikely. Whereas if you're from a country like Belgium, it's less obvious that your government really has the capability to do something like ban crypto. So all these strange variables like the size of the country you're in. And the government capability affect your conception of its viability. And then it's also interesting within Crypto itself that you have these two major platforms, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and they sort of attract different investor types. So Bitcoins got the sort of Association almost with Austrian monetary policy with some gold with preservation of value. With this sort of very trust minimized sort of slightly dark, slightly, almost Gothic view of humanity, and sort of Bitcoin as a sort of place greater safety wells. Helium is much more sort of visually about defy changing stuff. Much more software, much more network effects, much less consciousness of trust and store value, and you start to see the sort of bickering between those two cultures. And it's fascinating how you've got to sort of shilling points of showing points. Not only are they showing points at the economic level, but also showing points for investor personality types that go into them. What's interesting is if they continue to do that, they probably diverge far enough that there's no longer in fact any competition between them. Because they've diverged so much culture in aspiration's, there no longer direct competitors. One of the things that sort of entropy is how is wealth preserved overtime? And if you look at one of the best stores of value, it was forestry and there's two very interesting attributes. Forestry one is it's so boring no one ever bothers to seize it. So if you look at people that were in a country on the wrong side of the war and occupied by an invading power over the last 2000 years, things like houses and artworks were confiscated. Things that businesses for nationalized no one ever thought about forestry. It just sort of slid under the later and then the second interesting attribute of it was that the cash flow characteristics so tellable you have to wait 50 years for trees to go. You got very few investors and very few corporations doing it, because imagine building an Excel model showing a payback in 51 years. That's really sort of only two to 3% of your principle. It's so appalling you never go into it and therefore it had these characteristics. Work a superbly well. It's sort of interesting to think. What are the digital equivalents of things that have some psychological appellants to them and therefore actually will have great economic capture. Becauses something unappealing about them. What do you think the best examples of that last concept, our digital equivalents of, repel an asset? I think certainly up till 2017 script over that it was such a strange topic. The Association with things like Mount Box and Forward and Things just made it slightly sketchy. And then the abstractions that the lack of physical reality of it I think makes it unintuitive people. You can't touch it, can't feel it. It's sort of numbers in the Sky. Things like that just don't have psychological appeal. In the absence of psychological appeal, is a source of Alpha. What do you think the most misvalued asset in the world is today? I would say it's probably entrepreneurs in markets that are non obvious and I don't mean because their end market is not obvious. It's people addressing global problems, but in some secondary city in Romania, because capital markets at that stage is not efficient enough to find them as a famous company UI Path, I think now worth about 10 billion that came out of a mania and some visit Powder Matic example of that. I think if you were to say where is there a cool option. It's probably something in crypto, it may exist, or it may not exist. I think one of the questions is, is everything in that space Now Alta Vista exciting local space or is it at the Google and Amazon stage? It's a very, very hard question to answer in full sight, irritatingly obvious in hindsight, but it does seem there's a probability mass of something being very big there because there's something about finance where it's demarcated by nation state, even though it's a pure electron good. And so anything that's just pure numbers in the Sky should actually be globally scalable, but it isn't because of the existing finance regular environment and the existing historical paths. Sort of banks when they were physical institutions. That makes me think this globalization of finance has the potential for multiple trillion dollar market cap companies over the next decades. You mentioned Romania, which just makes me think of Europe. More broadly speaking. I'd be curious your relative. Take an opportunity in Europe for business and investing when the last decade has been relatively underwhelming. Certainly relative to the performance of US companies. It is amazing that if you look at the top 10, maybe in the top 20 by now companies in the world by market cap there exclusively US and China. There's an absolutely fascinating Staten says so much about the last 30 years. There's a very sort of dark kind of thought which says one of the best things about Europe is that you probably have a less geopolitical risk than any other place. There's something about the horrors of Salman Vadon, and Stalingrad that makes it some unimaginable for Germany and France to have a conflict. Well as. I think it is much more imaginable to have China, India, US. Those some countries have conflict, so in some ways one of the things you have in Europe is a sort of absence of systemic risk of wipeout. 'cause if you look at what we really destroys, investing returns its geopolitical conflict. If you look at the collapse of European wealth in World War One, World War Two, it's just absolutely epic and I think that maybe an underpriced benefit of Europe. I think the other, much more cheerful, practical one is. Their countries institutions weren't developed enough to build a Google. Arguably that's every other country apart from the US, but I think it is certainly true of very small European countries because they just don't have the complexity of legal system. They don't obviously means becoming public. They don't have the institutional norms or the depth of financing or anything like that. But now I see so many companies come out of Europe, the Delaware corporations LLC's that have, say, West Coast, you investors. The legal documents by Wilson Cencini or some other US firm, and you have this amazing mix of sort of Soviet quality education which is very high in math and logic. Post Soviet GDP per head, which basically means your capital goes very far when Honda labor Force, but with US high trust institutions acting to sort of scale it as a Corporation. And that unique coming together feel. Special. It's a fascinating take on everything. I mean, I had never considered really any of those angles. Again appealing to the 483 companies that you've invested in, I'd love to know the geographic dispersion of those things, generally speaking. Almost an even mix between USUK continental Europe would account for 90% with domain 10 scattered Twin Asia, Africa, Latin America with a particular hub in Singapore, 'cause when incubator called entrepreneurs first that I. Invest with a great deal you've had made on the show, which was a fantastic episode. I love his idea of the history of the technology of ambition. It's completely Maps IP, which was it's very interesting to think where counted. People go as a framework, and so if you go back and go the other way and say what can you learn from investing when you look at history, it's interesting. Think is an under estimated cause of the decline of some institution, not all the stuff people think about when they wrote about it, but just that very talented people who are young tries to go a different direction. So there was a time when you're a young man and you can choose. Do I go and do? And administration of Roman province? Or do I join the early Christian Church? Possibly the talent started to flow towards the church and away for moments Tutions and actually caused weakening? That is a generalized framework of where exceptional challenges to go. Super interesting. So one thought that occurs in our world is perhaps the sort of investment banks and consulting firms in all forms of tomorrow will be much less good than their precursors 2030 years ago, because so many talented people going into entrepreneurship and that talent has to pull out of somewhere now. I think again from a sort of societal viewpoint. I think putting bad times people in things that can scale their products to millions of people is higher utility than putting them in affectively, high-end artisane profession like consulting the law where the output. Doesn't scale, it seems to me that a lot of what you're doing with your life and career is curation of people. Ideas, companies, history. I mean so many different examples in our conversation today. I'd love you to riff on that idea of curation and whether or not it's going to become an increasingly important skill in a world that is exploding with information and content and data. Very simply is if you think back to sort of 30 years ago. Your basic problem is lack of information, so you sort of read about capital markets. Investors in the 90s and they're reading SEC filings, so leading sell side reports they're trying to get time with management, but it's a fundamental lack of information problem Now you look at the massive growth of available information and I think it becomes much more filtering problem and in some ways the best way to filter is to have second stage filters before your filter. Which is just to find amazing people and use them as filter points. So there's a sort of phase which is if you hang out with people smarter, harder working an Molly better than oneself. You always live in a funnel of positive serendipity, because, affectively, you're dragged upwards to the mean benchmark, which is higher than oneself. So that's what I try. To do. You just described my whole life. I'm playing with this idea now of it's better to be interested than interesting. And as someone that's never been particularly interesting, a great way to eventually become interesting is to be purely interested all the time. Yes. 100% and I think I tricked you could overlay amazing people in a unique configuration. You get an information flow that is both a creative to view. It pulls you up but is also a unique lens in the world and from unique lenses you get unique opportunities. By that, you just mean nonoverlapping kind of backgrounds and areas of interest in the people in your network. Yeah, I'm one of the ones that I think is always fascinates me is just part of geographically disparate networks. Often you get these very sort of tight communities. In some ways, the Valley in some ways sort of New York say the hedge fund community, and sometimes the most obvious insights are just from going between one to the other and just seeing the difference in worldviews in stark relief from each other. And so I sort of think about that constantly. I mean, one of the ones that's most powerful is just thinking Farmer say imagine, think about the same problem, not from the US perspective, but from, say I finished perspective on Albanian perspective and suddenly topics look very, very different. And there's a danger of defaulting to this because of US is sort of the world hegemon to defaulting to that mindset, and that's not always the. Best most predicted view. We've talked about a lot, and as we wind down, I'm curious what topic that we haven't talked about at all. You are most interested in. Of course, after we finish this, I'll think of tons, but I'm sort of failing to think of anything in the moment. I think it is one I would pick. It would be one of the things that sort of fascinating in sort of this trip. Tech is how much startups are Temple Inevitabilities. So as a phase someone said to me what's the difference between a hella tic under profit in tech, the hell it it gets burned to the stake. You know the profit becomes famous about two years. And you sometimes wonder how much timing matters. Was a site like Pinterest Always going to exist within a year that you could download a page of images on the Internet in under 100 number settings? Was that the sort of temporal inevitability of a product like that? And is it the same for most products? Was GPS and mobile phone did that make an Uber like thing inevitable in around 2000? Nine 2010? One of the great unknowns. Is the temple one and then I think the other sort of great unknown is how much a value is actually created for the top layers of the stack by the bottom layers that don't capture it. So are we all just the beneficiaries? Is Angel investing pure the beneficiary of the emergency WS measure? 'cause I can tell story whereby Angel investing just didn't exist because it was negative, although I see because you had spent so much in Sun Microsystems servers and sort of physical equipment. You just had poor R across the whole industry, then a WS in Azure come along and critically as a startup. You don't know your own future demand curve because you don't know when you're gonna get on market fit. So you either have to buy too many servers, in which case West Capital or too few, in which case you couldn't demand was with a WS measure. They've effectively taken that risk out of the equation and you can almost know that your cost base only scales with your success. Is the entire industry just sitting on that? I kind of in an intuitive field. It probably is better luck and good. Maybe we get an AI boom in the next couple of years. Maybe that would be written about as that bike. Do some email. Maybe it's actually Nvidia's ampere chips and the emergence of five and seven nanometer nodes. Just drive improvements in throughput that drives emele up so it's nothing to do with the companies that are actually working on it. It's to do with sort of. The pickaxe is being turned from wood to iron, making their work far more efficient, and but NVIDIA will probably capture some value of that, but probably won't capture the greater value. Same if you were to do I sort of history of early computing. The 90s and 2000s. Be interesting to write it from the importance of the evolution of Intel chips and modem speeds as the primary drivers, as opposed to. The mallet of history. But both these great companies. Will Charlie I feel like I could do this with you almost weekly basis and he sort of endlessly entertained by your prolific interest in so many different things. I'll certainly remember this conversation is one that's a reminder that investing in business are complicated. And if you want to spend your career in those spaces, you better love it because there are so many variables in so many things happening and you have to develop your own niche in your own strategy. My closing question for everybody in each of these conversations is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you. Oh my God, there are so many. There are so so many examples. I think it's probably a recurrent one of often. My enthusiasm has been greater than my competence and it's the people that bet on the enthusiasm more than the competence and internally grateful to them. I love that again, you're sometimes describing my life so I know exactly what you mean and it is a wonderful thing and major category of these answers is betting on somebody early. Seeing something in them and taking that risk is always a great kindness. Will try. This has been a highlight of my early week, even though it's just Monday. I really appreciate your time and I've loved all your insight. Thank you, thank you.
